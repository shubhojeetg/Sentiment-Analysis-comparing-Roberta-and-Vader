"We used this airline to go from Singapore to London Heathrow. We had issues with tickets as they cancelled one of the tickets and trying to get it sorted cost a lot of money due to roaming charges for the lengthy phone calls which were needed to get the ticket reinstated and them trying to charge varying amounts to resolve it. This was a very poor service. 

We got to the airport and had to check in at the desk due to this issue which meant online check in couldn't be done. We were in premium economy which was spacious, two seats on either side of the plane and 3 seats in the middle. The plane seemed relatively new but not brand new. Legroom was good, seats were wider and had bigger arm rest in between the two seats which had the fold away tray tables in. There was a good choice of movies and other things such as TV shows, games etc. The food was ok, didn't seem to be much different from economy standard. The flight crew seemed friendly enough. They didn't really go up and down the isles with drinks only maybe twice for the whole 13-14 hour flight, which on other airlines they would have done it quite often.

Overall the flight was ok, seats were comfy, legroom good. Food was ok. The flight crew could have been more attentive especially with it being premium economy, you would expect the service to be slightly better than economy.",0.019,0.871,0.109,0.9781,0.1950875073671341,0.41383007168769836,0.39108240604400635,3
"The service on Singapore Airlines Suites Class was nothing but excellent. The cabin crew was warm and friendly and, most importantly, came across as sincere and genuine. Throughout the flight, I interacted with Leading Stewardess Sharifah the most, who went all the way out to ensure we were comfortable and well taken care of. I saw her patrolling the cabin consistently to check if we needed anything(I could see her looking into the Suite), and she was always read y to assist us. She even offered to make up our bed after the breakfast run so that we could rest. When I asked if I could walk around both decks of the aircraft, Sharifah volunteered to show me around. She was very knowledgeable about the configurations in the A380 aircraft and even pointed to the best seats in each cabin class as we walked through. 

The Suites Class cabin resembles the private cabins onboard sleeper trains, which gives Suites Class passengers some form of privacy. The cut holes on the cabin doors, in the shape of a flower design, somewhat reduce the privacy we got in the Suites Class cabins. There are two lavatories at the front of the aircraft catering to the six Suites Class passengers. The lavatory on the right is the bigger of the two, featuring a vanity table between the toilet and the sink.  There is plenty of space in this lavatory for passengers to change into the Lalique pyjamas provided to Suites Class passengers. The lavatory on the left was smaller but no less luxurious. Passengers using this lavatory can still find it spacious to change in and out of their pyjamas. This lavatory still provides the same amenities as the larger lavatory. 

Not all suites have the same size. The biggest are the foremost Suites (1A and 1F), about 5m2; the smallest (3A and 3F) are the aftmost Suites measuring 3.3m2. I occupy the middle Suite (2A) with 4m2 of real estate. Each Suite is fitted with both a chair and a bed.  The walls of the Suite were printed with floral designs that enhanced the luxurious vibe and did not come across as being too loud or over the top, consistent with the design language of the cabin. A side table sits by the entrance of the Suite. The flight attendants use this side table to place our drinks or snacks without needing to deploy the table.  The table is solid and huge, providing tons of space for Suites Class passengers.  The table can be swivelled for passengers to get in and out of the seat without stowing it away. 

The seat was the first thing that caught my eye when I entered my Suite and is very comfortable. An oversized pillow is placed onto the seat to provide passengers with greater comfort, especially in reclined mode. The seat measures 35"" wide and can recline up to 45°. The calf rest of the seat can only be deployed when the seat is swivelled to face the TV or the front of the aircraft (the green light on the control panel would light up to indicate calf rests can be deployed). Swivelling of the seat is controlled electronically via the control panel built into the left side of its armrest or the tablet provided in the Suite. There are two power sockets that came fitted with USB-A charging outlets in the Suite, one at the side of the side table at the entrance of the Suite and another on the storage cubby by the window. Singapore Airlines Suites Class features a bed in the Suite on top of the comfortable seat. Singapore Airlines uses Lalique bedding for the bed. I found the bed was very sturdy, lacking in terms of comfort. The mattress padding was a tad thin and lacked cushioning. The two pillows that came with the bed were too soft for my liking. 

There is no lack of storage space in the Suites Class onboard Singapore Airlines. Besides the pockets and shelving on the bulkheads and the seat, there is a small wardrobe by the door. Due to the slim design of the wardrobe, a limited amount of things can be stowed here. There is space in the wardrobe for passengers to hang their jackets. The bottom part of the wardrobe allowed me to stow away my backpack. More storage is fitted into the bulkhead of the Suite. Due to the shallow design of these cubbies, I could only use them to store smaller items. Singapore Airlines designed an open shelving space with a single leather strap beneath the cubby holes. Singapore Airlines fitted a 32"" HD touchscreen TV in the Suite. The TV can be swivelled with a touch of a button either on the seat or from the tablet to face the passengers when sitting on the seat. There are two IFE controllers in the Suite; a smaller one is stowed in the seat's armrest, which I found very intuitive to use. The other IFE controller is via tablet in the Suite.",0.023,0.903,0.075,0.9935,0.01197671890258789,0.27613702416419983,0.7118862271308899,5
"Booked, paid and received email confirmation for extra legroom seats 10 Dec. 4 Feb checked and seas were gone. They resold our paid for seats and put us in standard seats.

"Premium Economy Seating on Singapore Airlines has narrow seats and poor leg room compared to Air NZ or Virgin.  Drinks served in plastic beakers, roast chicken tough as was the meat in the noodle dinner.  Orange juice concoction was not a premium offering.

"We booked our flights a full 9 months in advance and paid well over $11,000 for a trip in 2 weeks time. we then booked our trip around the flights. Over the past 2 months they changed our flights over 6 times resulting in over 15 hours of stop overs and delays, making the trip almost 32 hours long.
We booked through flight centre and paid the extra to be able to cancel the flights.
Now we're having to fight tooth and nail just  to get a response let alone our money back. 
We're now at the unenvious point of paying for litigation to reclaim our funds that they have had for 9 months to use as they wish.

"Respected Faculty, I am Bincy, writing this  to file a complaint regarding a cancellation of the connection flight of Singapore airlines and the irresponsible service from Singapore airlines airport staff members at Singapore .My parents 67 yr old Dad as 63 yr old Mom travelled from Brisbane airport in Singapore airlines  SQ236 yesterday at 14.45 hrs and arrived at Singapore airport at 20.25hrs yesterday late evening. Then only they were informed that the connection flight SQ 536 which was booked and  confirmed, has got cancelled and they have to wait until next day night. This was not informed to us in any form of communication. 
And secondly, though my parents are very older with so many health issues, (my parents are Diabetic also, taking insulin and my parents have high blood pressure, taking medications)but they had to wait in airport in a chair without any support for 24 hours without any food especially when they are from a non English speaking background. The mental stress and physical discomforts for 24 hours they were gone through are unimaginable and we cannot express it to the full extent. They didn't get any emotional or physical support from staffs at Singapore airport.They didn't arrange any room to rest or any proper lounge and not even any food for 24 hours (my parents were not prepared to stay at airport for more than 4 hours as  we booked the tickets with least transit time at Singapore airport)
We had a trust in the services of Singapore airlines, and so we booked the flight for our parents with much confidence. 
We booked the tickets through an agency Sanjo travels in India but we got the confirmation that Singapore airlines didn't inform the agency as well. So it's completely the mistake from Singapore Airlines.",0.064,0.906,0.03,-0.6737,0.7866054773330688,0.19476546347141266,0.01862906850874424,1
"I would rate Singapore airlines the worse I have ever travelled with.
The only plus was we left on time & arrived on time.
Firstly no one  brought headsets had to ask for one.
The bfst omelette was awful part yellow part brown, the rest inedible. 
The milk & butter if you get any! Now comes in liquid form squeeze tubes.
No decaffeinated coffee no hot chocolate.
We then had a wait of nearly 11 hrs without food, I went to the galley hoping to get a sandwich but all that was available was banana or kitkat!!!
Other than trays water nothing was brought around in the 11 hrs!! No choice of juice.
The films available where limited & not up to date.
Dinner eventually arrived again inedible no before dinner drinks , the trolley had a choice red wine or white wine ( Chardonnay) but you only got half a plastic cup of wine no repeats!!
I believe this cost cutting is to their detriment. Out of choice would never travel with them again.",0.128,0.861,0.011,-0.9487,0.8489261865615845,0.12844404578208923,0.022629836574196815,1

"Yesterday ( 6 March ) my flight was canceled by the Singapore airlines . After many calls they said that you bought the ticket through booking.com and call them and they should resolve this issue. and singapore airlines didn't want to talk to me anymore. 
I called booking.com and they tell me to call to Singapore airlines.I explain to them that Singapore airlines does not want to help me because I took the tickets through you. 
This went on for several hours. a few hours later Singapore airlines gave me another flight in another state( I bought ticket from JFK NY State , they give EWR NJ ; ) it will cost by taxi around 300$ from NY to Newark 
no matter how bad it was, I agreed and thought that I would fly the next day. but... when I started registering I noticed a mistake they made. 
They gave me a two flights : 
first from EWR - SQ 21	•	7 March 9:35 AM- 8 MARCH 5:25 PM Singapore airport .
 But my second flight was SQ 728  8 MARCH 
 9:50 AM from Singapore .
 How it is possible ? if the plane arrives in Singapore on March 8 IN THE EVENING 5:25 pm and second flight has departure is IN THE MORNING on that day?!!!!
 I called again to booking .com they send me again to Singapore airlines , Singapore airlines send me again to booking ( Singapore airlines did not want to do anything for me. 
if they wanted they would solve this problem!!!!
 I had a similar situation with Emirates airlines , my ticket also was booked from booking .com . 
Emirates  resolved same problem  quickly without any difficulties and with many apologies. 
But  Singapore airlines didn’t even apologize and most importantly, it didn’t want to help solve the problem that iT SELF CREATED .  
After many calls to booking.com representative told: WE DO NOT have any flight for your second connection. When I asked : What I need to do , I need to fly , I bought ticket . He said me ….. call to Singapore airlines . 
I explained again and again Singapore airlines send me to your company.
But representative said me : we can not do you second flight. Call to Singapore airlines. My vacation was ruined and I was very upset . I will never buy tickets through Booking.com again and never through Singapore airlines also. 
Inhumane people work here who do not want to solve the problem that they themselves created.
 This is a real mockery of a person . A SHAME!!! . I will write everywhere and tell everyone about such unfair treatment of people. I buy another ticket from another company , I spend my nervous, money , my time !!!

This was bizarre and now they tell me they will send my money back within 10 working days - so basically they 'stole' $380 from me for 10 days. I am a regular flyer with them and, sadly, have 3 more flights already booked between now and June - but they will be the LAST!!!

"Their Premium Economy cabin is a RIP-OFF. We always fly Premium Economy class when traveling international due to the distance. Very sad to report that we were very disappointed with the dimension of the seat. Due to the poor design where the tray is integrated into the arm rest, so the dimension they show on their site is BOGUS. The arm rest takes up at least 2 inches of the seat leaving you with  the actual seat size that is no larger than their economy class seat. DO NOT PAY the extra $800-$1000 extra for SIA PE Cabin. The footrest does not extend properly, and the seat DOES NOT recline like premium economy in other airlines. The service on the slight from SFO-SIN was great (good attentive stewardess due to higher ratio of staff to passengers, the bathroom was clean and they were generous with their food and beverage/snack services) but on the return flight it was truly a plain old economy class service. In addition to that, they were long delays while we were in transit which resulted in my missing my reunion luncheon with classmates whom I have not seen in over 40 years. The customer service of ground crew is not up the the SIA golden class services they promote. During the over 2-3 hour delay, we were in the waiting area which has no water or bathroom facilities. When I asked the crew how long the delay would be (we arrived early at 0730 for our 1100 flight, missing breakfast etc. ) I was told she has no information to share. Asked if there is sufficient time to leave the area to grab food and do a bathroom break (this was at 1230), was told she has no idea... 
All in all not worth the extra $$$$ and given the mediocre ground service, and the delays etc. I would not use them again, when there are so many other great options out there for premium economy cabins with other airlines.

Service was very poor. The cabin crew were not interested in passengers and systems were disorganized. My husband was skipped at breakfast time ... simply ignored. He thought they must be serving the other row only and going to come back to him. He had to request breakfast in the end. It was difficult to get water.

"Travelled from Man to BKK via Singapore and return. Outbound flight was on an Airbus 590 with the skewed sleeping arrangement which I found to be most uncomfortable. Although the seat was wide it lacked support for the lower back and I thought that the TV screen was much too close to the seat. The flight from Singapore to BKK on the B787 was little better as the seat was very narrow and the partition dividing the seats made it feel very claustrophobic. Again, I found there to be a lack of lower back support. This time the TV screen was further away. The return flights were very similar.
However, where Singapore airlines does score highly is in the way that the cabin crew look after the passengers; service was superb and nothing was too much trouble. Food also was so much better than any other airline we have travelled on, especially the Book The Cook option. Also, the lounges, with the exception of the one in Manchester, were first class with an excellent choice of food available.

"The trouble with being voted the best is that the only way is down. Such seems to be happening to Singapore Airlines. 

Let’s begin with the aircraft. It was an A380. It must have been one of the older ones in the fleet. My seat in premium economy was extremely uncomfortable. It seemed to be worn so the padding had become flattened. I had to sit on a cushion to achieve any kind of comfort on the almost 10 hour flight. Even then, my bottom hurt for a day or so afterwards.

Next, the food offering. Bland, tasteless and overall boring just about sums it up. My wife is gluten intolerant and she was offered virtually the same menu for both meals. Disappointing.

Finally, the service. It seemed to me that the crew were anxious to get home to Singapore. They didn’t seem too interested in the passenger client at all. My wife asked three times for some water…..it never arrived. Service was inconsistent throughout the cabin as I saw one side paid a lot more attention than the other.

On the plus side (there are not many), the flight was on time.

However, on long-haul flights, Singapore Airlines' business class B777-300ER has great service, seats, and food onboard. The flight crew is very friendly. They care about me and respond quickly if I request something. The food is really tasty, especially the Western style. I ate lobster thermidor, and it is one of the best foods I have ever eaten on an aeroplane. Besides that, their hard product is the top reason why I chose Singapore Airlines.

Economy flight from Singapore to Melbourne was absolute torture. Incredibly cramped cabin, genuinely felt much worse than a Ryanair type configuration... simply not suitable for an 8 hour flight. Food was atrocious, completely inedible. Absolutely stunned they are charging top prices for this rubbish. Took a couple of budget Jetstar internal flights whilst in Australia and they put Singapore to shame.

I  had actually upgraded the long first leg, Manchester to Singapore to business class...food and service was top class for this and I actually found the seat pretty comfortable for sitting...but as you will read elsewhere, the bizarre angle of the footwell makes achieving a comfortable sleeping position nigh on impossible.

Seats - very uncomfortable with large gaps between rear of the seat; cushion too thick so uncomfortable; a stupid calf extender which adds nothing to the comfort on a long haul.
Drinks service - very poor. Plastic cups for gin & tonic and also wine! Really? In Premium. Even worse with 2nd drinks service as wine given in cardboard cup as ran out of plastic. White wine was only Chardonnay- no choice! In Premium?

"Singapore Airlines feedback channel is one of the worst in the industry. Not only do they ignore customer feedback and request all the time, they also reply in a rude and unapologetic manner when eventually they do.

I have no idea where SQ hires all these customer service personnel from? Those that I have interacted with are ethnic Indians, so can i presume they are outsourced to India? 

For 2 incidents, I have feedback to SQ due to poor flying experiences. Both times, they never replied me, even after I sent 3-4 reminders. 

For the second incident, which was in January this year. I boarded a flight from Melbourne to Singapore. It was a very turbulent flight. And the kids on the flight were crying. But the air stewardess did nothing to solve the discomfort of these kids. 

In the meantime, the kid has urinated all over the seat and the urine has dripped into my bag which was stored under the seat. 

I complained through the feedback line. And the airline did not respond after even 3 weeks. I wrote 2 reminders, and only in the second reminder, when I threatened to escalate the complain did they reply.

In their reply, it was curt and abrupt. It was not apologetic, nor did it show that they cared very much. 

They said that since it was caused by another passenger, it was no responsibility of the airline. And hence they could not do anything about it. 

They did not attempt to help at all. 

I also, in my original complain, and in the 2 reminders, asked them to issue a Damage report, so I can go ahead to claim from my insurance. I had shown the leading stewardess during the flight what is the extent of the damage. And so I wanted a damage report. 

This was conveniently forgotten in the reply. I wrote a 3rd reminder, and they have yet to respond to it. 

This is the poor quality of the customer service that you get from Singapore Airlines. They dont really care about you, yet they charge astranomical prices for your airfares. While year by year, they are dropping from (once) the top airline in the world, now not even in the top 10.

I think there is something seriously wrong with the airline. 

The CEO is engrossed in cutting corners, from serving food in cardboard boxes to lowering the service standards of their steward crew, claiming it is COVID.

"It's taken a long time before I could bring myself to write this review, such was my level of disappointment with this airline. My husband had recently retired and this was our retirement gift to ourselves after years of working and raising a family. Needless to say, we paid a small fortune. To begin our sad tale, due to some glitch, we weren't seated together so we travelled all the way to Paris one behind the other.  There was no personal amenities pack - you had to ask for a sleeping mask, socks, toothbrush and toothpaste.  The aircraft was old, the food was only just edible and the blanket was smelly. Service was not what I expected -  we were invisible until they were collecting rubbish.  On the return flight, I had a bit of chest congestion and I asked the attendant for a sick bag and when she brought it, she told me to take it to the toilet when I was finished with it. The last straw was a meal that was supposed to be a beef stir fry but it was a dried up stew arrangement that was completely grey in colour. This was definitely not my expectation of Business Class, and, as we are 71 and 69 years of age, I think they could have done better. We have flown with this airline on numerous occasions but I will never, ever do it again.

"I booked premium economy as I wanted more leg room and a foot and calf rest. I have a disability and need to be comfortable. Staff were excellent on boarding and I was shown to my seat. Leg room was good and seat seemed comfortable. However there is nothing premium about premium economy. After takeoff we were given a snack, but nothing to drink. I asked if I could have a drink and was advised that drinks would be offered later. Why would I want to eat a snack with nothing to drink. I waited and waited. There was no bottle of water in the seating area which should have been there. After 1 hr and 20 mins finally it looked like drinks were being offered. Juice or water only. Me and my husband were missed out. We thought they would realise so waited patiently. Staff had got to economy when I got up and asked if I could have a drink as we had been missed. After waiting nearly 2hrs we finally got a drink of orange juice. Another round of drinks was offered later again juice/water tea or coffee. After nearly 5 hrs we were again offered juice or water. I asked for wine by that stage as sick of juice. To the staff members credit he got it for me. Dinner was offered with a bottle of water only. Once the trays where cleared about finally the drinks trolley with champagne was offered. My seat did not recline correctly and my TV froze twice. The staff are all lovely but there is nothing premium about premium economy. Not enough staff and very slow service. They clearly do not want to offer more than 1 alcoholic drink on an 8hr flight. The seat eventually reclined with the help of staff and was comfortable. Will never pay the cost for premium economy. As no premium food, service , and dirty toilets.

I pay almost 1600 euros for this trip to Perth. I can go for cheaper with Malaysian Airlines, but I chose Singapore because I thought they were still the same as before. They seem to have a problem with partner airlines. So when Lufthansa canceled my flight, Singapore booked me to SN Brussel so I could catch my flight to Perth.

"This journey I took recently with Singapore airlines was one of the worst in my 12 years of international travel experience. I boarded in Coimbatore, India via Scoot airlines( operated by Singapore airlines). The flight was delayed by 2 hrs. They kept saying delayed by 30 mins and kept moving the time. There was no reason given. Food was not that great too. Staffs were mostly friendly except one. There was no ice cream with kids meal and it came only with adult. She gave my husband and me, we asked one more for our 9 year old daughter and she refused saying it was not part of the kids meal. Anyways, even though flight was delayed, i was hoping they would make arrangements with out flight to Seattle. However, they just made us run, literally... We were at the terminal finally and their systems did not recognize the boarding pass we had and they made us wait further for validating us manually. It was 12 hrs flight to Seattle. Seats were so close and narrow like a bus seat. Not comfortable at all. When we landed we were told that our checkin bags did not arrive and it would take 4  more days to arrive but we would be compensated. As I was tracking I only got email that they were trying to locate my check-in bags without exactly updating the actual status. Then the bags arrived 4 days later. I wanted to reach out to customer support for compensation they promised at the airport. There is no customer care number you can reach for these kinds of questions. There are onlu forms and emails to send. I am waiting for response for the last 10 days. And there is none yet.

"I wanted to express my frustration regarding the difficulties I've encountered while attempting to redeem miles for flight tickets with Singapore Airlines .

I've consistently faced challenges with the redemption process, often finding myself placed on waitlists for flights. Furthermore, on multiple occasions, approximately two weeks before the scheduled flight, I've received notifications of cancellations, despite my repeated attempts to secure bookings. This uncertainty and last-minute cancellations have greatly inconvenienced me.

Compounding the issue, despite my efforts to utilize my miles within the required timeframe, I've faced expiration of my miles due to these ongoing challenges. As a loyal customer, this experience has left me deeply disappointed and discouraged from further engagement with Singapore Airline.

I urge you to review and address the issues within your miles redemption system to ensure a smoother and more reliable experience for your customers. Your attention to these matters would greatly enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.",0.078,0.783,0.139,0.7925,0.7927775979042053,0.17995817959308624,0.02726423554122448,2
"In the bigger scheme of things among all airlines, it provides a high level of service and offers a good product, though not outstanding. Staff service was professional and efficient but somewhat lacking in genuineness. Service, especially on the outbound, was very rushed. For example, the pre-departure hot towel was given and taken away before I could even touch it. Cabin crew can best be described as highly efficient but perfunctory. There is a high degree of helpfulness but also kind of stern. Seating was the same kind for inbound and outbound even though they were on different types of aircraft (B787 and A350). One is lucky to get flat-bed seating on a regional flight, but the seat is just uncomfortable, too narrow, and the head “wing” gets in the way and blocks the view from the window. The 3-point seatbelt was also uncomfortable. Food on the outbound was awful, even when it’s from “book the cook”. The duck was dry and pathetic looking, and tasted like it looked. On the inbound, the fish dish was excellent and succulent. I wonder if it’s from the Bangkok kitchen rather than from the Singapore kitchen. Beverages were good, with Piper Heidsieck champagne and a very good port, though the pre-takeoff champagne was served warm. There was strangely no beverage menu -- only a food menu with wine list. For the Singapore lounges, Terminal 3 lounge is renovated and expanded, and world class. Terminal 2 lounge is dated and in need of a revamp. The main issue with the Singapore lounges is the food – only mediocre local food is served. It is a real shame that there is no Western food, or other kinds of Asian cuisine such as Japanese and Middle Eastern. Singapore is not known for tasty food or fine cuisine, and the lounge food clearly reflects this. The lounge wines were very good, however; especially the 2 kinds of white. Lounge staff were rather surly. The Bangkok lounge was good enough for its purpose of being an outstation lounge. It has enough quantity and variety of seating and adequate F & B, though there are no showers. F & B on the whole – both on board and in the lounge – was one level below that of Qatar, though Singapore has better consistency in the various other aspects. Online check-in was very smooth and painless. You need not go to a counter nor get a paper boarding pass.

"In short: 
Greedy airline that will try to rip you off. We bought two way tickets (Booking confirmation 5ATUE4) during one of their promotion periods and the hidden fine print terms of these tickets are outrageous. Our plans had changed so that we had to take an earlier flight but they insisted they will cancel our return ticket as well if we don't use the outbound ticket!!

When we complained to their customer service we were promised to be called back at 3pm the next day - but just received a short missed call at 6pm the next day (same time zone..) and no further follow up. 

They used to have great customer service - very sad to see them become just another greedy airline that doesn't care about its customers and tries to make an extra dollar wherever they can.

I can understand that we should fully pay for the first non-refundable outbound flight (even if we don't take it), but it makes no logical sense (other than to make extra money) to then deny us the right to use the return flight at the later date that we already paid for in full. 

Very disappointed in Singapore Airlines - used to be a great airline. After dozens of flights with SQ in the past, certainly not our choice of airline going forward.",0.151,0.765,0.083,-0.9402,0.9281519055366516,0.06354601681232452,0.008302098140120506,1

We could not fault the reception through Changi airport starting from the First class reception and check in to the lounges. Unfortunately this changed after we boarded the flight. The inflight service was below par. The inflight crew presented as flustered, disorganised and appeared not to be working as a team. This was completely different from SQ286. Meals were served sporadically, meals being disorganised with very little enthusiasm, it was like the staff were just going through the motions to get it out of the way. This was very clear during the second meal which we pre ordered a main as it was Lunch, The cabin crew were very difficult to understand due to the quiet tone through out the flight. We were given breakfast with choices of cereal, fruit and breads followed very quickly with a main pre ordered meal of steak and my wife had burger, this was very strange and not appetizing it could not be eaten.
The climate control on the flight during sleep period was extremely hot. During this period no cabin crew were within the vicinity to ask about this.
It appeared that the First Class cabin crew were not as professional as the crew on  our flight SQ286.
Very disappointing return flight as this was a special occasion for my wife and I.
Also the advert for First class had a teddy on each bed which our grandchildren were excited about having unfortunately on both flights this was not the case and were advised  they had ran out. again another disappointment .

I informed them I don’t need their $75 voucher and that I will make a formal complaint about the plane’s defects.

"Singapore's status as one of the world's great aviation hubs and a leisurely gateway to the riches of Asia is largely down to the decisive role played by the city state's flag-carrier Singapore Airlines over the past 70 years.

The award-winning airline's history dates back to 1947 when its first flight, a twin-engined, eight-seater Airspeed Consul, departed from Singapore for Kuala Lumpur.

In the intervening seven decades, Singapore Airlines has developed a sky-high reputation as one of aviation's most pioneering and innovative carriers: it was the first airline to fly the Airbus A380 Super-jumbo in 2007, and was the launch customer for the ""ultra"" long-haul version of the Airbus A350 that can fly for up to 20 hours non-stop.",0.0,0.881,0.119,0.9321,0.0014106221497058868,0.13622790575027466,0.8623614311218262,5

First of all, we had all flights delayed by an average 2 hours. 

Second of all, one piece of luggage was lost in transit, so we had to stop in Mumbai Airport to file a missing luggage report.
During the report filing, the staff of Singapore Airlines recommended, using lies, to declare false statements to Indian Customs, i.e. declare a lower amount of value in the luggage (15,000 INR instead of 35,000 INR).

"I am a regular flyer of SIA on this route.
In the recent travel, I found the SIA management has decided to continue degraded service in this route (and in other routes).

I am not sure why it is Skytrax's number-one airline.

The service level is still a degraded version relative to pre-COVID in this route. 
--there is no snack packet/fruit juice before meal service
-- Toys to kids are of very cheap/degraded quality relative to pre-covid and other top-level airlines such as Emirates, Qatar

"Singapore Airlines is a good, quality airline however, has room for improvement. The crew onboard were attentive, friendly and always willing to help. 

The food onboard was excellent - really tasty and good sized portions, however, fewer meals and snacks were provided compared to other Middle Eastern airlines flying a similar route (2x meals compared to 3x in a 13 hour period). Snacks were available on-request or if you visited the galley, however, passengers were not made aware of this and had to investigate for themselves.

Similarly, amenities such as toothbrushes and toothpaste are found in the bathrooms and again, passengers are not made aware of this unless they asked.

Onboard entertainment is great, with an extensive library of TV shows and movies to choose from - none of which seemed to have content censored as some Middle Eastern airlines do. 

My biggest complaint for Singapore Airlines was the onboard lights were dimmed shortly after departure and remained off for the majority of the flight (approx 10 out of 13 hours), despite the flight arriving in the late afternoon in London. We arrived in London when it was dark, having sat in a dark flight, therefore not seeing light for nearly 24 hours until we woke the next morning. On other airlines offering long-haul flights like this, they light the flight and offer meals at times to help passengers adjust to the destination timezone. Singapore Airlines appeared to make no attempt to do this and it meant that while it was light outside the plane for several hours before the aircraft lights came on, we stayed in darkness for most of the day. 

The other issue we found was that several passengers were allowed to bring several bags of carry-on luggage (3+ bags per person). As such, there was no room for our 1x backpack in the overhead compartment and I was forced to fly with it under the seat in-front, significantly compromising my legroom and comfort on a 12-hour flight.

"Singapore airlines has become a disgrace to its legacy. The airline was once one of the best experiences a person could have traveling but has now devolved to the level of a poor US airline like United or American. They charge exorbitant fare and get away with it while continuously decreasing the value of their service. Being a member of the airline comes with little to no real benefit any longer. The customer service is terrible, the attitude of the airline employees is significantly worse, and the experience on the whole has become one that makes one want to find alternatives. If I am going to be treated like, I would be fine to fly a lower cost carrier. In the end, if not for the privileges it gets for being the national carrier, it would quickly be out of business.

I complained via email telling them I sat on the plane looking at a blank screen for the duration of my flight and think a 75 Singapore dollar voucher is poor and I would like a upgrade flying back or a bigger voucher amount, they literally just emailed me back saying sorry the staff was unfriendly and that’s the voucher we give to solve this type of issue, so basically deal with it.

"I have been flying Singapore Airlines for 42 years. There is no question that it is not the airline it once was. However, on this route it is still far far better than any other option. Service is far better as is the food, etc than United. My last business flight with United was shocking. Service was non existant and food on the long flight was just sad. As one passenger said who had slept through a meal - “Do you just have kids food for snacks?”.  Cathay Pacific was a form of torture with tight seats and flight boarding that is total mayhem. SIA is trying and still the best. I would warn you that having traveled with them after two surgeries in the past the wheel chair service in Changi  is abysmal and the United Polaris clubs are nicer.  SIA is also particularly hard to get a status match - even for United 1K or Million Milers. They also have a website that rejects a lot of itineraries meaning you have to book separately. Where they REALLY  are TERRIBL is communication as it is nearly impossible to get a human. The chat feature proved useless for me recently, even after he forwarded an itinerary that an agent said was impossible. Very frustrating! At least United has good Milage Plus service and no PIN is needed to contact them. However, I JUST booked a flight with SIA and know I will have several more in the next year. They are the best over the Pacific if you don’t mind the nightmare of their website and customer service. ",0.09,0.794,0.116,0.8722,0.49542129039764404,0.33139097690582275,0.173187717795372,4
"We booked a trip on Singapore airlines in premium economy.  This was for their 19 hour flight to Singapore.  It is a really long flight so I called to see if we could upgrade to Business class.  I called on two different occasions and was told by two different agents that we could upgrade for a certain dollar amount.  They upgraded us AND charged my credit card for the agreed amount.  I thought we were all set.  I then got an 'urgent' email from Singapore airlines saying that I needed to call them.  I called them and was told that on our outbound flight business class was sold out BUT Singapore airlines wanted to honor their commitment to upgrading us so they upgraded us to first class on the outbound flight and business class on the return flight.  Again, I thought we were all set.  Then I got a call from Jason Chang, employee number 00520, one of the supervisors, and I was told that the person I talked to incorrectly upgraded me and didn't charge the correct amount.  He told me I could upgrade if I wanted to pay an additional $15,000.  $15,000 was WAY higher than what I was told previously.  I explained that Singapore airlines made the mistake and they should honor the price they originally quoted.  Jason proceeded to yell at me.  I told him I didn't appreciate his tone of voice and that I wanted to speak to a supervisor.  He told me he was the supervisor and that I couldn't talk to anyone else.  Then he told me he was going to cancel my entire reservation.  For an airline that prides itself on great service, this was awful.  Not only did they not honor the original agreement but the way I was talked to by Jason was insulting and misogynistic.  We actually booked with Singapore because other friends told us they were a good airline.  If I had to do over, I would not use this airline.  The customer service we received was AWFUL!

Extra recline also made a difference and  was bearable even when the person in from was reclining.

Food was good although had the option to Book the Cook prior to flight.

I know some airlines are starting to increase leg room to 40 inches SIN (38) which would be great when you consider the extra money that is paid.

On our return from Croatia at Frankfurt there were flight delays which meant we would miss our connection from SIN MEL But both Lufthansa an Singapore Airlines made this a much less stressful experience, in fact a great little adventure. At FRA we received meal vouchers and were updated regularly by helpful staff and when we arrived in SIN everything was organised as soon as we got of the plane.

Meal vouchers, hotel vouchers, Taxi to hotel and back, assistance with getting our entry visa on arrival.

"Singapore Airlines Business Class offers an unparalleled flying experience. It's a blend of luxury, comfort, and exceptional service that transforms travel into an indulgence. For anyone looking to fly from San Francisco to Singapore, I wholeheartedly recommend Singapore Air Business Class. It's not just a flight; it's a journey that celebrates the art of flying, setting a benchmark for what air travel should be.

World-Class Service: The Flight Attendants' Touch

The heart and soul of Singapore Airlines are its flight attendants, and the crew on 
Singapore Flight 33 exemplified this perfectly. The world-class service began from the moment I stepped on board, greeted by smiles that felt genuinely welcoming. A special thanks to Victor (IFM), Tan Wee Song (CS), Lionel (LS), Howard (FS), and Scarlette (FSS) who went above and beyond to ensure my comfort and satisfaction throughout the flight. Their professionalism, attention to detail, and warm demeanor made me feel valued and well taken care of.

The Culinary Experience: A Gastronomic Delight

One of the standout features of Singapore Air's Business Class is its culinary offerings. The menu choices, including Lobster Thermidor, Seared Sea Bass, and Grilled Filet Mignon, were not just meals but culinary experiences that rivaled some of the Michelin Star restaurants I've dined in. Each dish was prepared with meticulous attention to flavor, presentation, and quality, making dining one of the highlights of the flight.

Comfort Redefined: The Business Class Seat

The Business Class seat on Singapore Air was a haven of comfort. The spacious, fully-reclining seat provided a perfect environment for relaxation and sleep. With ample legroom, adjustable lighting, and a range of seating positions, it was easy to find the perfect setting for every part of the journey. The privacy and quietness of the cabin added to the sense of exclusivity, making it feel like a personal retreat in the sky.

In-Flight Entertainment: A World of Choices

The in-flight entertainment system was another aspect where Singapore Airlines shined. The wide selection of movies, TV shows, music, and games meant that there was never a dull moment. The screen was large and high-resolution, ensuring a great viewing experience, while the noise-canceling headphones provided by the airline allowed me to immerse myself in the entertainment without any distractions.

Attention to Detail: Small Touches that Matter

What sets Singapore Airlines apart are the small touches that show their commitment to excellence. The amenity kit provided was thoughtfully equipped with high-quality essentials. The restrooms were consistently clean and well-stocked, reflecting the crew’s dedication to maintaining a comfortable environment. Even the cabin lighting was adjusted to mimic the time of day, helping to reduce jet lag.

The Lounge: A Pre-Flight Indulgence

Before boarding, I had the pleasure of visiting the exclusive Singapore Airlines lounge. The lounge was a tranquil space, offering a variety of seating areas, delicious food, and an array of beverages. It was the perfect place to relax and prepare for the flight, adding another layer of luxury to the overall travel experience.

A Commitment to Safety and Cleanliness

In an era where health and safety are paramount, Singapore Airlines demonstrated a rigorous commitment to cleanliness and safety protocols. The cabin was immaculate, and the crew took great care to ensure that all health guidelines were followed without compromising on service quality.

The Singapore Airlines Business Class Experience

Having traveled to Asia in First and Business Class for the past 25 years, I can confidently say that Singapore Airlines is among the best. Their attention to every aspect of the flight experience, from service to comfort to dining, sets them apart. The crew on Flight 33, with their exceptional service and dedication, played a pivotal role in making this one of the best flights I’ve ever experienced.

Anticipating the Next Journey

This unexpected circumstance has caused considerable distress to my father, as he perceives it as a lamentable level of service offered by the airport staff. Regrettably, no contact numbers were found online to establish communication with the Singapore airline and discuss this troubling situation.

"Singapore Air may have some of the best in-flight services and amenities but its customer service center and hotline is atrocious. I had booked my flight via one of their Star Alliance partner airline (Egypt Air) and was told by Singapore Airlines subsequently that the booking class in Egypt Air is ineligible for miles claims. After a few rounds of back and forth, Singapore Airlines said that they would process my miles claims if Egypt Air provided proof that it is eligible under Egypt Air's system. I obtained the necessary documents from Egypt Air and Singapore Airlines acknowledged this proof in July 2023 and agreed to reimburse my miles claims within 6-8 weeks. 4 months passed and my miles were still not credited and I reached out to Singapore Airlines again, and they told me that my Egypt Air booking class is not eligible for miles claims. It is as though all my efforts between May to July 2023 went down the drain. When I resurfaced Singapore Airlines previous emails promising that they would process those claims, they not only did not acknowledge it but merely pasted template answers each time they replied me. I tried to call their hotline but was put on hold for over an hour. I requested callbacks and was given specific timeslots for the callbacks but when the time came. My phone did not ring. When I emailed them to say that I did not receive any callbacks, Singapore Airlines merely said they tried but could not get through. If the agents truly tried, why didnt they immediately send an email to inform me of their effort? Instead, I have to initiate all the conversations. Once again, this is such a horrible experience that as a Singaporean that used to fly Singapore Airlines and/or Star Alliance whenever I travel, I would stop doing so. There is no benefit from being loyal to one airline and/or alliance these days when they treat their customers so atrociously. This is such a huge disappointment.

"Recently used Singapore airlines, unfortunately flight from UK to Singapore was running 45 minutes late, we just made our onward flight from Singapore to Lombok. Service at Singapore was excellent.
Our bags did not make the onward flight.
These things happen, however the service we then had was terrible, the customer service rep at Lombok was useless, we landed , were then informed that our cases were not on the flight, told we would get them three days later, ABI the service rep filled out the paperwork. Turns out he did not fill in the forms correctly, he did not give us a tracking number, he did not make copies, so waste of time as forms that were filled out he gave to us.
We then used Singapore airlines online/live chat to try and find out where our luggage was. They were very unresponsive as they did not have a lost luggage tracking number, I thought they could enter our luggage label number. 
Told me to go back to the airport, since this was nearly a two hour trip I declined.
ABi did not answer my texts to my Satisfaction, when cases did arrive at 1030 he said he had to Finnish his shift at 15.00 before sending them on.
When he did send them on we had to pay for boat to bring cases over to island we were staying on, then pay the local taxi to bring them from the boat to the villa.
This could have been way more professional.

"I specifically chose to fly with Singapore Airlines due to my positive experiences in their Economy Class from years ago. Having explored premium Economy options with various airlines since then, I was eager to give Singapore Airlines another try, considering their esteemed reputation and my previous impressions.

Regrettably, the experience fell short of my expectations. Both legs of the journey, from Zürich to Singapore and back, featured uncomfortably cold cabin conditions. While the staff were friendly and hospitable, I didn't sense the distinctive Singapore Airlines ambiance I remembered.

What disappointed me even more was the absence of an amenity kit. Additionally, having to share toilets with Economy passengers was less than ideal, resulting in lengthy queues reminiscent of standard Economy travel. The meal service was identical to what one would receive in Economy. While the privilege of checking in and boarding ahead of Economy passengers is granted in Premium Economy, I questioned whether it justified the higher price point. Personally, I found that the added value, aside from extra legroom, didn't justify the cost.

I must admit that Lufthansa and ANA offer significantly superior Premium Economy services. They provide access to lounges and offer amenity kits (in the case of ANA). Even LOT surpasses Singapore Airlines in terms of attentive staff.

"Subject to a 5-hour delay which then caused us to miss the connecting flight and extend the delay to 30+ hours. We were placed in a hotel by SQ adjacent to the airport for a sudden 24hour plus layover near midnight with a ""food coupon"" that we had to fight for as we were starving due to the long delay and no food service on the plane. After arriving at the hotel we found out that those food vouchers were not even valid according to the hotel, Capri by Fraser, and no food service was available. Capri by Fraser's on duty manager in Singapore apparently said they don't take ""food coupons"" from Singapore Airlines for emergency layover guests and that this was a miscommunication with SQ. At near midnight where nearly all restaurants were closed and Capri is far from the city center, how were we expected to get a meal after being misled by Singapore Airline staff at the airport about the availability of food and their miscommunication? What if we were first time guests in Singapore with no knowledge of the local language and not able to navigate the situation? This is a complete failure from a management perspective as delayed passengers who miss connecting flights after a certain time at night should at least be informed properly if not put in a hotel with 24 room service/dining options in or nearby and given the courtesy of not having to worry about starving on top of rearranging travel plans etc. For an airline with a world class reputation where one pays a premium for the service this just is not acceptable.

I submitted a complaint to Singapore Airlines but their complains team threw a response back at me: “as much as we acknowledge the inconvenience you went through as a result of the delay, as an industry practice, and in line with our Conditions of Contract and Carriage, we would like to share that airlines generally do not compensate for consequential losses or inconvenience arising from flight delays.” However, I know international passenger rights stemming from Article 19 of the Montreal Convention which covers delays due to fault of the airline. SQ senior customer service staff repeatedly mislead and misrepresent int'l passenger rights trying to essentially brush me off.

There is a lot more to this story but currently they have ceased responding to my emails and appears to think that ignoring the issue will fix it. I don't know what more I can do at this point but I hope this review will serve to shed light on the holes in SQ's 5 star service and ""World's Best Airline"" reputation.

"We were offered the choice of carriers from England to Vietnam and chose this airline on the basis of a friend's recommendation and that he had been impressed when he had last used them. Priority check-in went smoothly, however the friendliness of the staff left a lot to be desired. The lounge was clean, tidy and a full selection of hot and cold meals and liquid refreshments provided.
The flight to Singapore was very comfortable with a large seating area where you could fully stretch out, however some of the cabin crew gave the impression that explaining the various controls and screen changes was beneath them. The menu was good  and the meals were tasty. The lounge again was average, however noise and distractions from other traveller's spoilt the ambience.
From Singapore to Vietnam the cabin crew were attentive and extremely responsive. This was a slightly smaller airliner, however the seating arrangements were adequate.
The return trip was basically similar to the inward journey, but the cabin staff were perhaps more attentive due to it being mainly a night flight and they had more time to devote to each passenger.
The central seating means that it is almost impossible to have a conversation with your ""flying"" partner due to the distance between parties. Each passenger is provided with headphones, blanket, cushion, socks and footwear, however the entertainment choice is severely limited.

"A decent airline with some room for improvement. I've had the opportunity to fly with Singapore Airlines a few times this year and each time I come away with different feelings. The consistency in service that you find on other airlines doesn't seem to exist with Singapore Airlines. Sometimes it's great, sometimes not so much. On this particular flight from Singapore to Dubai, boarding was late by about 40 minutes - not a huge deal but the lack of communication was frustrating. Boarding was relatively quick and the Airbus A350-900 is a fantastic aircraft to fly on. The seat was comfortable (economy) and there were nice amenities for use during the flight, such as a pillow, blanket and headphones. I opted to use my own noise cancelling head-phones connected to the In-Flight entertainment via a cable. As the aircraft pushed back, a flight attendant quite rudely told me ""noise cancelling headphones aren't allowed!"" Before I had the chance to ask why, she had already disappeared. When she passed again, I asked her about her prior instruction and she told me that I could not wear them during the safety video. At this time she realized that they were in-fact connected to the IFE and said that I could keep them on. 

The first meal-service didn't start until almost 3 hours into the flight! For those, like myself, who had connected through Singapore from a previous long-haul flight, it was frustrating having to wait this long as I wanted to maximize rest for the arrival into Dubai. The second meal-service was a slice of over-cooked pizza in a soggy cardboard box. Disappointing to say the least.

"I recently travelled with Singapore Airlines to Singapore/London from Sydney and return. Whilst flights SQ242 and SQ221 were reasonable my flights SQ306 and SQ321 between Singapore and London were dreadful. 
I am a pensioner, doing occasional casual work, and it has taken quite a while to save up for this trip. As I have arthritis and I'm 75 years old, I persuaded my travelling companion to book premium economy. On previous trips, with Cathay and Air Canada, I had been upgraded to premium economy and found it to be much more comfortable than being in economy.

I cannot understand why Singapore Airlines thinks that the Boeing 777 is suitable for premium economy, and I feel exploited. The seating was so cramped that you could hardly get out of your seat to reach the aisle. When the person in front reclined their seat movement was almost impossible. How is this better than economy?

On the flight over my t.v. screen malfunctioned for 3 hours and I could not watch anything!! The flight crew did everything they could to fix it and after all that time they finally did.
 On the return flight I could not recline my seat which made it very uncomfortable trying to sleep.
Additionally, on this flight, the middle toilet seemed to be out of use, so we had to walk to the very rear of the plane. In fact, we had to walk further to a toilet than anyone else on the plane! I was very unimpressed given the huge amount of money we paid for premium economy.

I have been fortunate to have travelled several times in my life, and this experience with Singapore Airlines was the worst travel experience I have had with an airline. This is more so because I expected more, given the amount I and my friend paid for premium economy. I did expect it to be better than economy.

I might also add that when I tried to log in to Kris Flyer in the plane I could not do so.
Almost everything was unsatisfactory but the very cramped space and poor value for the dollar were the worst. Given that Singapore Airlines was recently named as the world’s top airline, I would have to strongly disagree. My only positive opinion relates to the ease of checking in and the pleasantness of the flight crew.
Singapore Airlines has not replied to my last email, which I guess is what you would expect!",0.055,0.854,0.091,0.9058,0.7637393474578857,0.18940052390098572,0.046860139816999435,1
"I have used SQ and Changi often and generally praised both. Unfortunately both have declined significantly in the last few years - be wary!

The SQ631 HND-SIN experience 4 October 2023 is the worst airline experience of my couple of decades of international flying.

All was going to schedule on the day and all passengers boarded and the plane commenced taxiing. Part way through taxiing, the plane pulled over into a parking bay and passengers were left sitting for 1.5hrs with no announcement! I asked a crew member if they knew anything about what was going on and was just given a stupid answer of ""normal delay""! So if flying SQ it is now 'normal' to pull into a parking bay and watch engineers on ladders inspecting something in the engine bay!

Finally after 1.5hrs of sitting a brief announcement ""technical issue"" still trying to be resolved. It was around another 1.5hr of sitting before the next announcement stating we'd have to wait around 20min for busses to come and take us back to the terminal.

Passengers understand that things can go wrong but to just leave us sitting for 1.5hr with no announcement whatsoever is ridiculous ...and then another 1.5hr!

Finally we're all bussed back to the terminal and left sitting for an hour or so before some incomprehensible announcement in English is made apparently to queue up for meal vouchers for lunch. What should be a 5sec process per passenger to hand out meal vouchers (show boarding pass, have it endorsed and be handed vouchers) was an excruciatingly long process with the huge queue moving about 50cm a minute.

And then staff ran out of vouchers!!! More waiting for staff to find some more. Finally get vouchers which could only be claimed at a cheap food court upstairs which was already crowded with no spare tables.

A number of staff at the gate were standing around dumbfounded and others looking busy walking around with tablets asking questions but not achieving anything.

No offer of overnight accommodation and flights the next day, one had virtually no choice but await an email with what alternative flights SQ decided to hand out. So what should have been a pleasant day flight to SIN turned into an overnight nightmare arriving SIN 2:20am and having to wait 4.5hr for flight to KUL with no offer of accommodation or lounge!!! I had to ask for accommodation/lounge at Changi and only then given a pass for the Krisflyer Gold Lounge - thankfully better than nothing but not the standard expected of supposedly one of the world's top full service airlines.

Flight SIN-KUL 7:00am 5 October had no entertainment facilities and not a single scrap of food was offered - not even a packet of peanuts!

Overall SQ's performance experienced is now that of an expensive budget airline - not worth the premium anymore - avoid!

As for Changi, I went to meet my girlfriend at the gate earlier in the trip and observed the plane arriving at the gate but passengers and gate staff all had to wait half an hour for somebody to operate the airbridge! Seems Changi and SQ management are following suit.

"I have never come across a company that would ask a customer to pay a penalty fee for switching from a cheaper to a more expensive service

I bought a one way Economy class ticket from the US to Singapore (ticket number 6182446679719/reference number 5932KI) at first, planning to take another airline for the other leg of the trip.  

Being a loyal customer of Singapore Airlines, I decided to be more generous and pay a lot more to buy a 2-way Business class trip (ticket number 618-2446953857 06/reference number 54GRQ5) in place for the original one-way Economy class ticket.  

I cancelled the one-way Economy class ticket after buying the 2-way Business class ticket and found to my horror that Singapore Airlines charged me a cancellation fee of US$200!  I called Singapore Airlines and wrote in to ask for the US$200 cancellation fee to be waived and refunded.

The experience was a nightmare and the response was shocking to a long time customer.  It took a long time to get through the hotline.  My request for refund was rejected with no good reason provided. 

What is the motivation behind the rejection?
- why would the airline want to squeeze a customer for a few extra dollars after being paid a few thousand US$ more by a customer to buy a more expensive service?  Is this even reasonable?  I like to invite any customer to comment on this point

"My family had used two tickets each out of a four leg journey when I had to change plans for myself only due to a very sudden family bereavement.

Despite our tickets being already half used and strictly non-exchangeable, SA agreed to defer one of the legs for myself only so that I could accommodate a brief extra journey before completing my original route a few days later.

This was done via an online chat with the minimum of fuss and bother, with very little notice from my end.

This concession from SA saved me a significant sum of money and a lot of unnecessary extra air miles. I’m incredibly grateful to them for their flexibility and willingness to help me in what was a very stressful and emotional situation.

"It's not what expected. After seeing so many positive reviews about the airline, I thought I should give it a try. I walked in with positive expectations, but I walked away very disappointed.

Singapore Airlines is really overrated. First, the seats in the economy class are extremely uncomfortable, both in terms of cushion and size. It's very narrow, making you feel like are packed in a sardine can. For flights longer than 6 hrs, it's pure torture. Second, the foods served in economy class, are lower than what you might find at McDonald's. The inflight service is also overrated. The flight attendants (FA) are very robotic. They'd put on a polite smile and respond to your request in a very artificial, insincere ways. And this gets worse with head FAs. What may you see on Singapore Airlines commercials/advertisements are not the reality. The aircraft cabin environment in the economy class can make you feel like you are on a Greyhound bus, if not worse. Furthermore, most Singapore Airlines flights converge to Singapore (because it's their hub). And the airport itself (SIN), is also grossly overrated. It may look sort of ""modern"", but there many little ""stupid"" things that they can improve on such as flight information monitors availability and accessibility. 

Overall, Singapore Airlines would *not* be my future choice of airlines for my travel.

"had previously flown with Singapore Airlines and had a positive experience, so I booked again. I have been extremely (!!!) disappointed. 

I do not recommend flying Singapore Airlines if you have any dietary intolerances, requirements or allergies. Before flying: (1) I requested a gluten intolerant meal; (2) I contacted Singapore Airlines through the app; and (3) I also checked that I was all sorted for gluten free upon checking in at Sydney Airport. 

Despite the staff member at the airport providing confirmation, the staff on the second flight (from Singapore to Paris) told me that they had no gluten intolerant meal for me onboard or any record of the request. I then went 13 hours without any substantial food, as I had only brought muesli bars with me (between the initial flight of 8 hours and then a 13 hour layover, I couldn’t bring much else). The stewards offered me a vegetarian meal as an alternative, but this had barley etc (so not suitable). 

The crew onboard and at the airport were both very nice, so that is the only plus I would give to Singapore Airlines. I felt like they were pleasant and tried to make the experience better. However, when contacting Singapore Airlines via phone some weeks before to enquire about re-routing my flight, I had to wait on hold for quite a long time when I just wanted confirmation as to whether I could change the flight at all. It turns out that they have to manually calculate re-routing the flights, which is fair - however, I kept just asking for them to confirm whether it could be done and couldn’t seem to get a simple answer. 

In my subjective opinion, I felt that the seats were more uncomfortable than other similar airlines. The gentleman in front of me on the second flight put his seat right back, so the steward assisted me to find a temporary new seat which was kind of him. Again, the staff at check-in and onboard were lovely and the only plus I would give to the airline. 

I have since contacted Singapore Airlines about the experience and got a very generic short email noting their  sincere apologies and a query about whether I needed to select gluten free on the flight back. I replied in more detail, and have since received a reply addressed to somebody completely different (definitely not me - a completely different surname) saying that they already booked a gluten intolerant meal for my inbound flight (which is contrary to their previous email). 

I would never personally book with Singapore Airlines again and am absolutely dreading the flight back. ",0.035,0.88,0.084,0.9768,0.3454991579055786,0.4545554518699646,0.1999453753232956,1
"We recently flew coach on Singapore Airlines from LAX to Tokyo’s Narita Airport. Our experience: It was great. The onboard service (talking coach here) harkened back in quality to the older days of flying: elegant, professional, attentive, super-personable flight crew; clean well-maintained cabin and toilets; comfortable seats with decent leg room; exquisite (for plane food) meals with proper utensils; good selection of films/programs on functioning devices. The time onboard passed by easily, and we arrived in Tokyo without that just-rode-in-a-cattle-car feeling.

I used to fly often when I was a kid (mostly internationally, from the early 70s to the mid 80s). The golden age of flying was a faded point in history by then, but I remember how the default quality and dignity of customer service by airports and airlines still hinted at the privilege of air travel. I contrast that with my more recent experiences with air travel: zoo with wings. You want to see a third world airport? Have a look around JFK. A classy one? There are a number of them (maybe start with Istanbul), just not in the US. You want to fly on a US airline (just successfully fly point-to-point on schedule, not aspire to have a quality experience)? Roll the wheel and test your fortunes.

Lately, it’s gotten so unpleasant that my wife and I chose to take a cross-country train to LA to catch our flight from LAX to Japan’s Narita Airport rather than endure airport shenanigans and the snafu potential of trying to fly out of NYC to make a connecting flight. It’s as if certain companies have forgotten how to conduct a commercial transaction. Me pay for goods and services, you give me said goods and services. But our collective sacrifices will allow some poor CEO to have a hot, nutritious meal, so perhaps we can write it off as charity work.

"It's not the old Singapore Airlines anymore.

The check-in counter only open at 9pm. The passenger service officer who helped the check in process cannot speak English and keep asking for re-entry permit to singapore - which is unnecessary. I declared that i have fragile item and requested to put fragile sticker on the luggage.

My flight was supposed to depart at 12.05am. However the plane was just arrive around 11.30pm and the previous passenger only left around 11.45pm. I only board the plane around 12am. it's really like budget airline - not enough time to clean the toilet? 

The food, they only serve one item which is noodle for supper. i sit next to the window with brown stain which has not been cleaned. just hoping it's not human body fluid. Pretty disgusting like flying on budget airline.

Upon arrival i found my luggage was damaged. but i was too tired to report it on that day. However i put this on my feedback form around 1 day after my arrival and no response from them.  after 10 days, i send another feedback using the web form and get a reply from their Customer Affairs Supervisor that they cannot do anything as i reported more than 7 days. 

Paying more for Singapore airlines, i expect they can at least do investigation to find possible issue or make promise to improve the quality - which they did not share any. not even an apology.

"Wow! Singapore Airlines you do not disappoint!

Everything was a masterclass in service. We love everything, The 'book the cook' is a novelty. I wish they provided pyjamas as it will make the sleep experience better and more luxurious. 

If we are becoming picky, they need to make sure their cabin manager greets the guests in their seats. I would not have noticed this but the Manila to Singapore and Singapore to Manila leg did this consistently. It was amazing! It was a pretty full flight but the manager took his time to thank each guest and welcome us one by one! This is a whole new level! I wished I remembered his name because he deserved to be praised. However, the Singapore to Auckland cabin manager did not do this so I think this really depends on the manager on board.

"I will give no star for Singapore airlines if you TripAdvisor has no star for rating. Because I had a terrible experience from Singapore Airlines at DPS (Bali). They have no rule for getting the line. I pay extra for my ticket because I don’t want to wait and getting lines with economy tickets, BUT the coworkers of Singapore airlines at DPS airport don’t care about what I pay extra for. Thus, they let economy passengers who has child go to the airplane before me, doesn’t matter I getting the lines at business lines before them.
Firstly, I don’t know why economy passengers who has children can go before me event I pay extra for business tickets. The economy passengers has only 1 child, but they go with 10 adult from 30 to 50 years old. OMG child looks a like an express ticket, that has more powerful than business and first class tickets. 
Secondly, if you guys rule can let them go with business lines, so they need to getting the line right? The rude things from Singapore airlines coworkers is they let those rude people skip the line and go before business and first class lines. That is so mean and rude service. 
Third, in the airplane one of passenger has coughed like 30 minutes, that he couldn’t stop. The cabin crew didn’t come to ask him or help him at all. They should tell him goes to the bathroom or give him hot water or at least try to help him, but they didn’t do that.

"Not happy at all with the service provided on Singapore Airlines Premium Economy on the A380. I flew on the Boeing 777 from Sydney to Singapore, and then the A380 from Singapore to London. The 13 hour journey was quite a struggle despite spending a significant amount of money on premium economy seats it did not live up to expectation at all!
 Felt like we were treated like economy class despite paying a huge amount more. Firstly there was no hot towel or drink before takeoff which was disappointing and would have helped feel relaxed and refreshed before takeoff. 
In terms of the seats the leg room was decent, plenty of room to fully extend your legs but the seats were not that comfortable. 
In terms of entertainment, it was good had a solid range of movies and shows to watch on board, would recommend to put more than 1 season of tv shows, as people want to binge watch seasons on a long flight. However, really disappointed there was no live sport, I was keen to watch the Premier League whilst in the air but it wasn't available on the A380 which was quite annoying and I was not happy with that. The WIFI was also terrible, it was only available for about 30 minutes of the trip, again disappointing. 
In terms of food I was very disappointed, the book the cook is a great initiative with some great options. The food was okay, not the best quality but it was sufficient. However, this is my biggest problem! There was only 2 meals provided on a 13 hour trip. Within a day I would usually eat 3 main meals Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner over the course of 12 hours that I am awake. On this flight you were served breakfast 1 hour after takeoff and then lunch 4/5 hours later. Meaning for the next 6 hours there was no food to eat. I had to ask the flight attendent for a snack, also ate some of the snacks provided but was still starving. There needs to be another substanstial meal before a few hours before landing. 
In terms of service from flight attendents it was okay, they came through regularly with drinks which was good, however in terms of amentity kits you have to ask for them, and they were so bad with barely anything in them. It was disappointing. In terms of treatment from flight attendents I didn't feel like I was looked after for the amount of money I paid. If this was economy, I would be pleased, however I paid a significantly large amount of money for the premium economy experience and I wasn't impressed at all. 
In terms of toilets we also had to share with economy, despite it being promoted as having our own toilets 
Overall it was a very average experience, and needs to be better. I am very disappointed as I had high expectations of singapore airlines and wouldnt recommend it to friends or family unless something changes. ",0.137,0.749,0.114,-0.9467,0.7603217959403992,0.19432392716407776,0.04535428807139397,1

I am 5ft 8 weighing 146lbs and my wife is 5ft 4 weighing 126lbs i.e both small and yet we were in discomfort the entire 13 plus hours on the plane. The seats were uncomfortable and the actual legroom worse on any plane that I have flown on for the last 30 years.

Facilities:  These would have been ok but one of the toilets was without water although a bottle was provided.

Food:  I am Coelic (cannot have Gluten) and my wife is vegetarian. We notified the airline 6 months in advance and it was registered in the app. The flights were not made aware of this even though I could show them the Singapore Airlines app with the dietary requirements. On the way out a vegetarian meal was not available for my wife. After some searching  I was provided with a gluten free meal and then the hostess placed a normal gluten bun on the top making it inedible.  On the way back the only meal I could be offered was breakfast consisting of a vegetable curry which was not very palatable as a breakfast.  The drinks are served in flimsy plastic cups, the sort that you might get from a water fountain.  These were so flimsy they deformed in your hand making drinking from them difficult.  At main meal times no tea or coffee was available.

Service:  I had heard so many good things about the service but it was inattentive and lacking.  On a 13 1/2 hour flight I expected frequent supply of water an drinks.  These were not proactively made.

 In Flight entertainment:  The choice of films was ok and on par with some of the better airlines.  I was disappointed that every film started with a bunch of advertisements for watches and lifestyle products that could take up to 5 minutes before the start of the film.  This was unexpected and irritating.

"We flew with Singapore airlines from Copenhagen to Singapore, then from Singapore to Cairns on a Sunday. One of our luggage was lost. At Cairns airport, we have been told not to worry : when the luggage would be found, it would be delivered to us, wherever we may be. We insisted on the fact that we were on a 3 weeks road trip and would be moving every day, a little further to Sydney, but the staff at the airport reassured us they would send the luggage wherever we may be. 

We had a first call with an employee of Singapore Airlines, named Suzan, on Monday, saying that the company lost the luggage. She promised to call again the next day to inform us about the ongoing investigation to find it. We insisted again on the fact that we were on the move and Suzan said it wouldn't be a problem to send the luggage at a specific address.  

Unlike what was promised, we had no news on the next day. We then tried to reach Singapore Airlines on the next day, without success. That’s indeed when we found out that the number she used to call us was only one way: we couldn’t call it, only it could call us. Suzan finally called back on the evening of the Wednesday saying that our luggage was found.  

When we said that we would be in Ingham the next day, we were answered that it was too far to deliver the luggage! We were very surprised by this answer and started arguing on that topic, since we've been told the exact opposite since the beginning. When we asked if there could be a compensation linked to the loss, Suzan laughed at us, which we found very disrespectful. She even ended up hanging up on us!  

As we were wondering about what just happened to us (maybe it was the “Australian way” to deal with customers), another employee of the company called us back right away. We then found a compromise: since we were passing by the city of Innisfail on the next day (Thursday), we agreed to meet a courier there to get our luggage back. We gave our itinerary of the next days: after visiting the falls of Milaa Milaa and Elinja, we would be heading to Mamu Tropical Skywalk. We were almost sure not to have phone reception there and informed them that we would only be reachable when arriving closer to Innisfail, around 12 (lunchtime), time at which we agreed to meet the delivery person. 

The driver was supposed to have been given our contact details and to call us when leaving Cardwell in the morning to set up a meeting point in Innisfail. We arrived at 11.30 AM in Innisfail and then waited for the driver’s call to head up to a specific meeting point. But we received no call, and we waited for 1h30 in Innisfail for the driver to call us. We even tried to call Singapore Airlines, but every person we were speaking to had no idea of what the situation was, neither who to re-direct us too, they simply advised us to send another email. Since we had to be in Ingham at the end of the day (we had a hotel reservation there), we couldn't stay any longer and had to move. During our trip to Ingham, we took time to write an email to the email contact we had received in Cairns to explain the situation. We had Wifi that night and the next morning but received no answer to our email. At that moment we were very stressed because we had no idea what could have happened to our luggage. 

The next day, Friday, we had to reach Townsville because we had a ferry booking to go to Magnetic Island. When we were on Magnetic Island (with poor reception), we received a call at 11 AM – the exact time he was supposed to call us the day before.

What happened during that call was beyond disrespect. The person pretended that he tried to call, and email us the day before without success. He even mentioned having sent at least 10 text messages to both our numbers. Which is very strange because we had reception for sure from 11.30 AM, since we managed to contact Singapore airlines helplines ourselves. We received no text message nor email! He also said that since he couldn't contact us, he went up to Mamu Tropical Skywalk and consulted the register (that everybody is supposed to sign but we never were asked to at any time) to find out we never went there. We were so shocked because it meant that he was calling us liars. We went to Mamu Tropical Skywalk, we have pictures of the place and we have hotel reservation in Yungaburra and Ingham to prove our itinerary too. So we can’t understand why he would use this excuse.

On top of that, he said that he had money compensation with him, but since we didn’t show up in Innisfail, he wouldn’t give us the money anymore. Which means that since this day, we didn’t receive the compensation mentioned. And to finish the call, the driver informed us that we had no other choice than going to Townsville's airport to collect our luggage in the afternoon, otherwise, they wouldn’t take care of our file anymore. So in the end, the promise to deliver the luggage wherever we were was never met. 

We were so angry and frustrated during the call, that we stopped arguing and just wanted to get the luggage back not to waste our holidays with stress anymore. Another really strange thing: following this call, we both received a text message from him, from Suzan and also an email to confirm where the luggage would be sent, and we received all text messages, calls and emails sent at that time on both phones. We wonder why we didn’t receive anything the day before.

To sum up, it took Singapore Airlines 5 days to get us the luggage back. We received only 150 Australian Dollars to cover this loss, which was clearly not enough to cover 5 days of clothing / hygiene product / snorkeling equipment / ... that was in the luggage. We waited 1h30 in Innisfail for nothing. We had been charged for international calls with both our phones several times due to the poor communication of both companies. We had suffered a great deal of stress and frustration, we had been laughed at and disrespected and we had been called liars!

"Note: This review includes SQ47 (Economy) and SQ422 (which was in Business)

SQ used to be my home airline, and I used to really enjoy flying with them. I was looking forward to experiencing them after the pandemic, and I was left with mixed feelings, being disappointed after the first, and impressed after the second?

My first flight from Vancouver to Singapore, I was waitlisted for an upgrade. However, this caused a problem with my ticket, resulting in about a 30 minute check in process. Additionally, the check-in staff requested my OCI (an Indian overseas citizenship), despite my second flight being on a separate ticket made from a different mileage account, and the check-in staff only checking the bag through to Singapore, as they apparently couldn't see my onward booking. They tried to avoid this question, and while I suspect it was so they could charge us extra in Singapore, since the baggage allowance is different for flights from Singapore to India, I won't make any assumptions.

My initial reaction to the seat was that it definitely felt smaller than the older A350 seats (since I believe these are the same ones used on the 787 with a narrower cabin). I was seated in an extra legroom seat for this flight (48K), which I recommend if you're flying on the A350. It has a window, great legroom, and if you're relatively small, you can also get out into the aisle without disturbing your seatmates.

I have to say, the entertainment system aboard SQ is great. Additionally, as KF members, we had access to unlimited free wifi throughout the flight, which worked great, and which was surprisingly fast. I ended up using it the whole flight. 

The food on this flight was substandard. The first meal was fine, a bit on the small side, but I was OK with it. The second meal, however, was very low quality, and dry. Considering there were only 2 major meal services, I expected something more substantial, and with SQ being named ""Best Airline in the World"", I definitely expected more. Attached with this review is  a picture of a similar meal served on my Emirates flight a few weeks later. 

However, what really disappointed me was the service. One of the crew members working my section was very friendly and warm. However, I witnessed poor service from the other crew members. The other crew seemed to be a bit hostile. When I went to get snacks from the aft galley, the crew members were extremely unfriendly, and seemed quite annoyed when I asked what options were available. Also saw 2 crew on the other side of the cabin screaming at a passenger who went to use the washroom before takeoff (which is completely understandable lol, so I didn't think much of it), but throughout the flight, they seemed to be unfriendly, and later screamed at a passenger seated near me who asked a question about the special assistance they needed disembarking, which is unacceptable behavior. 

Crew are extremely important to any experience, and growing up, I remember the friendly service from crew, and the care they treated children with aboard flights, which really built a strong image of SQ for me. However, I never saw that for the children seated behind me from the majority of the cabin crew, and to me, this shows either a drop in standard, or a lack of training. I have experienced friendlier cabin crew aboard budget airlines like Swoop, which certainly doesn't charge the same as SQ. I've seen poor service on SQ (particularly on flights to the US, including in business class), but this was worse than what I've seen before, and I really hope this is not caused by lack of crew rest, as I noticed the crew working most of the flight.

In Singapore, I have to say Changi cannot be beaten. It was still a very smooth experience, and brought back many childhood memories, not having changed much in 4 years imo. I had access to the lounge on my second flight, and I have to say the new KrisFlyer lounge is great. Good selection of food, and lots of seating.
 
SQs medium haul business is smaller than their LH product, but is still very comfortable. I wish they modified their 787 seats to take advantage of the wider cabin on the A350, in business and economy. The bed is comfortable, and the seat is well designed overall. It's good to see this kind of product on medium haul/short haul flights.

The food on this flight was excellent. Had Laksa from the Book the Cook menu, and it was easily one of the best inflight meals I've had. The service on this flight was very different, much friendlier, and very attentive. All the crew went above and beyond on this flight. Although service standards are higher in business class, I do think the service definitely exceeded what I have experienced in business before. I wish these crew were deployed on the longer flights.

Overall, after the pandemic, I'm left with mixed feelings about the airline. The first flight was very disappointing, nowhere near what my experience with them has been before. However, my second flight was great (although it was in business). This experience has definitely put me off flying SQ, and given my experience with EK this summer, I would definitely fly to India next time using the 3 big gulf carriers over SQ. I hope SQ really takes their service and catering more seriously, as I have been seeing other people complain about dropping standards too.",0.068,0.77,0.162,0.9985,0.2151838093996048,0.40320953726768494,0.3816066384315491,3
"Oh how the Premium Economy (PE) service has dropped on Singapore Airlines (SA) - not good compared to other PE serviced airlines. In PE you pay extra (a lot extra) this normally includes individual welcoming, a hot towelette and in many cases a drink prior to takeoff.  None of this on SA it was an extraordinary amount clutter and confusion through out the PE cabin. One alcohol drink prior to meal service with there wine pours being half a small plastic glass , no offered alcohol drink at meal service, meals through ""Book the Cook"" were not good at all but oh offered plenty of glasses of water throughout trip.

"I haven’t even gotten on my flight yet and my experience with the online booking system and customer service reps has already been infuriating.

On their Upgrade page, I was shown a price of $0.00 to upgrade to Business Lite from Premium Economy. Only after I clicked to complete the upgrade was I shown a different screen saying Id paid approximately $2,000 per person.

I immediately contact their customer service.

1. No one could explain to me what the $0.00 cost shown meant, if it didn’t actually mean $0.00
2. I got opposite answers on whether I could keep my original ticket if I denied the upgrade charge 

Not only did I get opposite answers (eg yes, you will be able to keep your original ticket; no, you will not be able to keep your original ticket) within 20min, I also go no explanation as to why the responses were changing. It was as though their reps were just making things up.

"I flew a 15 hour flight from SEA to SIN. The flight attendants were outstanding in their wanting to help passengers. I noticed that a Margarita pizza is offered for a snack, and also another one brisket with noodles. I decided to make Brisket pizza with those two snacks.

It turned out fine but, a little spicy because of the flavoring in the Noidle dish.

"After paying $11,000 for return journey for myself and my daughter we were both disappointed with our value for money. I particularly paid the extra money for a decent leg rest for my hip problems. Unfortunately the leg rests are of little benefit and the seats don’t feel a lot different to economy seats. The food was nothing special. We felt very tired and disappointed so tried to upgrade to business class at the Singapore airline counter at Singapore airport. No one was particularly interested in listening to our problem and only offered us an exorbitant price to upgrade one leg to Manchester. I don’t understand why we can’t negotiate on these fare upgrades considering there were plenty of empty seats in Business Class. We have to travel back to Melbourne on the 1st October and are not looking forward to it. We wouldn’t recommend Singapore airlines.

"Review of Singapore Airlines Flight SQ227 Singapore to Melbourne 12 September 2023

On reflection, just another flight locked into the entertainment world available on the back of the seat in front of us before sleep overwhelmed the world? Well, yes, but the most memorable thing about flight SQ227 was the sense of the few people involved - or so it seemed at the time. Sure, there may have been estimated 280 fellow passengers and crew on the Airbus 350-900* that night but, there was this sense of flying >6,000 km Singapore to Melbourne with just a handful of other people – a relatively short flight and time moved quickly.

Checking into Terminal 3 at Changi Airport was a doddle – drop-off from the taxi in front of the terminal and straight into a large empty cavernous terminal. There against the pillar to the left was the single scales to check weights. Then the short trolley walk across to the self-service check-in machine – which provided boarding cards and luggage tags – the instructions on the screen had been clear and easy to understand. Finally, the baggage drop-off on the conveyor behind. Again, the instructions were clear. You need to stand out of the way as the machine photos/registers your separate bags one-after-the-other before they disappear into the back blocks of the airport.

We seemed to have had the place to ourselves – there had been no one ahead of us and there was no friendly help waiting to check our bags at the auto-check-in machine. Staff from an adjacent manned check-in had watched from a distance. Pleased with our experience so far and, with plenty of time in-hand, we headed for the café behind check-in to share coffee before our Singapore minder returned home. It was a novel experience.

The first people en masse we saw were our fellow travellers queuing to gain access to the lounge at the gate. But even here such was the large size of the lounge, with everyone seated and few people standing around the departure gates to the air bridge, the place seemed empty. It was quiet. Boarding was called – orderly, quick and still quiet. With seats at the rear of the aircraft, we boarded with the first of the economy passengers.

It was a night flight departing 22.00 h which meant darkness most of the way - window blinds came down immediately the plane lifted. There was an evening meal around midnight and then heads down. Melbourne is two hours ahead of Singapore, so that meant 7.30 h or so flying time. With sunrise around 06.00 h in Melbourne we could have expected light in the cabin for the final hour of the flight except most people appeared to be sleeping through – blinds down and the cabin remained dark until the ‘breakfast’ snack arrived an hour before the final descent from Adelaide-on. You could follow the flight path on the screen.

Food services had been exemplary – courteous, efficient, ‘that extra mile’, etc. Dinner was delicious – shrimp/salad starter, hot veggies/meat main and strawberry dolce to follow. Cheese & biscuits too. The ‘breakfast’ snack before landing – mushroom and potato wrap – was less attractive – too savoury. Where were the alternative cornetti to compliment the coffee? We figured breakfast at Tullamarine Airport while waiting to be collected. We did – it happened – time in which to reflect the flight.

Night flight, darkness, quiet and little movement up-and-down the cabin makes for highly convenient air travel except … the economy seat was not particularly comfortable. It was small and narrow - with a short seat panel beneath your thighs and limited flexi-room from one side of the seat to the next. Not a seat in which to slump/sleep easily. And then there was the turbulence that started when crossing into Australian airspace – and remained for much of the flight.

Tullamarine Airport continued that sense of travelling without people - the terminal was empty. We were out-of-the plane and through the auto-immigration-check in 20 minutes. Long walking distances. Our luggage was on the carousel by the time we reached it. Amazing. Similarly, there was no queue backed-up at the customs authorities – hand over that declaration form and we were through. Half-hour from one seat to the next including a toilet stop? Coffee & croissant on a seat in Hudson’s Café never tasted better while we waited to be collected.

*Singapore Airlines operate a fleet of >60 Airbus 350s with more on order. It’s currently the second largest commercial A350 fleet worldwide. They come in three configurations for medium haul, long haul and ultra-long haul. The longer the haul the fewer the passengers carried. Medium haul routes typically carry 300 passengers when full, two flight crew and cabin crew in the ratio one for every 50 passengers.

Entertainment system with wide selection of movies. Free wifi, which worked well. USB ports and power sockets at each seat on the LAX-SIN flight. On the short SIN-BWN flight there was a USB port only, which was very weak and didn't charge my phone. Special meals were better than average. Both flights arrived early.

"My partner and I visited the lounge twice (September 22 and June23).
Both times we experienced the same problems - surly staff, poor food and the worst, showers/toilet cubicles which weren't operational.

The furniture has now seen better days and needs upgrading. 

Food was breakfast each time and poorly catered for vegetarians.

The lounge has male and female toilets as well as a unisex shower facility which has around 5 cubicles. 

The first time we went in September 22 I used the shower facilities to go the toilet which they also have in the cubicle. When I emerged, I was berated by a female member of staff for using them & told they were only for booked shower sessions. No one else was using the cubicles at the time and with only 4 areas within the male toilets to use, didn't think this was a problem given over 80 people were in the lounge at the time with 2 flights scheduled.

The next time of our visit was more recently in June 23 only the situation with the bathroom facility had gotten worse. The same rude member of staff was still there but this time she had placed 5 ""Out of order notices"" on each of the 5 shower cubicles. When I asked if they could be used, again I was berated and told that they needed to be booked in advance??? ""Were they working and can be used?"" was my reply. She just kept shouting at me and telling me to use the male toilets instead.

I suspect the shower cubicles were in working order at the time but due to the staff member not wanting to clean them after customer use, put the notices up.

This wasn't the professional experience we were expecting with Singapore Airlines given the long flight ahead we wanted as stress free and experience but unfortunately the opposite occurred.

Singapore Airlines needs to up their game and quickly correct the above issues at the lounge for an approved passenger experience.",0.08,0.886,0.034,-0.9144,0.788603663444519,0.189355731010437,0.02204066887497902,1
"Having been a little over 50 years since I lived in Singapore as an army brat, and having distant and vague memories of life back then, I was looking forward to being able to go back and refresh.
 The last time I flew to Singapore was 1969 as a fresh faced and very active 4 year old. My mum was 8 months pregnant with my sister at the time and had to deal with me for 18 hours back then. I don't remember much about that flight sadly but i do have memories of my time there. 
We booked our flights in time to also take in the Singapore Grand Prix while there in late September 2022. On seeing that the flight was 13 hours and not being the best flyer in the world, I was a bit apprehensive of how I was going to be cooped up in a seat for that amount of time.
 We flew on a Boeing 777Er aircraft which I have to say Singapore airlines have done a great job giving you ample leg room. I am not a small bloke at 6 foot 1 and 100 kilos, but found the room allowed was plenty for me.

"I had a wonderful time flying with Singapore Airlines (PVG-SIN) SQ 833 on 9th September 2023.

The craft of service was Airbus 380, on my previous review i had mentioned that the middle seats are a little uncomfortable since one has to pull out the foot rest and cannot enjoy it while taxing takeoff and landing. In the side seats there is a natural cushioned footrest on the side crease which is comforting throughout the flight. (It is fixed and needs not to be pulled or pushed).

The F&B service and the crew is very polite and caring. The F&B selection is was good on this flight, but sometimes its really not upto the mark.

One can even try and book the front row seats which have a very comfortable and wide front den for foot rest.

Much thanks to: 
Chief: Jamie
Leading Steward: Leslie
Steward: Sean, Jeanette, Stella, Yi Jie and Isabel.

"My experience flying from JFK to SIN last month was nothing short of remarkable. The plane was immaculate, food was delicious, the staff were amazing, and the 18+ hour journey just seemed to fly by (no pun intended). If you are ever so lucky, you may cross paths with Janice Ong Beng Guat, an airline stewardess on one of my flights. She displayed such a high level of excellence in customer service. She gave me a ton of tips of where to eat, what foods to try, and things worth seeing in Singapore. Her kind nature and attentiveness were present throughout the entire flight. Such a sweet lady!

Thank you Singapore Airlines and Janice for making the start of my trip all the more special and memorable! ",0.048,0.754,0.197,0.9696,0.0013662816490978003,0.008645218797028065,0.9899885058403015,5
"“Personalised service? You can’t get that in many airlines nowadays, much less in Economy class.” This is a statement that I always see in the comments section for flight reviews on YouTube. Being an avid traveller and a frequent flyer in Economy class, this would be a statement that I would agree with to a large extent based on my experience on Singapore Airlines and other airlines carriers during the pre-and-post covid era. However, Singapore Airlines has proven me wrong today during my flight from Hong Kong to Singapore on SQ899 on 13/9/2023. When I was at my seat, I requested a set of playing cards from a friendly Air Steward named Mr. Cedric Chan. He was very hospitable and he was very professional in explaining to me that the flight today had no stock of playing cards. As I was already told by the air stewardess on the flight from SIN to HKG on SQ 898 on 9/9/2023 that they had no more cards, I simply brushed it off and told Mr Cedric that he did not need to worry too much about not fulfilling my request. 

It was much later during the flight that really surprised me. Mr Cedric Chan gifted me a Singapore Airlines bag and placed amenities such as socks, sleeping masks, and bathroom slippers that could be used for my next flight with SIA in November. He took the time to chat with me about our travels in Hong Kong and we even talked about our National Service days when he realised that I was still serving my National Service in Singapore! Both of us discovered that both of us love collecting SIA memorabilia and are Harry Potter fans! When he realised that I would be travelling to London on 7/11/2023, he quickly recommended the Warner Bros Harry Potter studio. When I went back to my seat after our chat, he came back with one more set of amenities for my dad and he gave me 2 Business class Menus as a souvenir to make up for the lack of playing cards. I was sincerely touched by his gesture and he came to my seat again to bid me farewell before landing. 

Overall, thank you Singapore Airlines for the unforgettable memories with you on my flight from Hong Kong to Singapore, please keep me updated on the acknowledgment of Mr. Cedric Chan’s efforts!",0.035,0.885,0.08,0.9387,0.02764037437736988,0.2172476202249527,0.7551119923591614,5
"My flight experience was made so much more enjoyable by Christine Seah and her team on the SYD-SIN flight. They were professional, friendly and keep us well fed.

The flight left an hour late and arrived in Singapore just as my other flight was boarding.  Of course, it had to be the furthest boarding gate.  We ran, took 2 trains and made it puffing out of breath. On reflection, there were 7 passengers trying to make the same connection and it would been courteous to round us up and put us on an airport mover, rather than individually finding our way.

Christine helped us with the wifi onboard and it was quite decent speed.

I loved the dessert trolley. It was not an easy decision to select one.The inflight menu of nasi lemak with chicken thigh was delicious.

Sleeping was a bit awkward as the design of the leg compartment is at an angle to the seat

Thank you to Christine, Sherine, Luqmian, Jordan, Fizah and Yuko for a very lovely flight.

"The Singapore airlines service we experienced was exceptional on our recent trip from Brisbane Australia to the Maldives. I will find it hard to fly any other airline after our experience. Normally we go business but decided to break flight up and stay a night in Singapore & checked our bags through to Male !
Best thing was to fly through the day & get a good sleep then head off following morning - we landed in Male refreshed ready for our Island adventures !! Flying on the afternoon flight with great headsets and exit row and fab movies with a stop over @ the Crown attached to the airport in Singapore was just the best and I have to say the biggest thank you all the air hostesses and especially to - FSS Ismar Nurlinda Binte Omar (Linda ) on SQ 431 MLE- SIN on 30/08/23 who went above and beyond giving us business class care in our economy seats!! ♥️🙏🏼",0.053,0.72,0.227,0.9893,0.0018966376082971692,0.009981865994632244,0.988121509552002,5
"After a pleasant stay at the Silver Kris lounge in Brisbane it was time to board the Singapore Airlines A350-900 in their regional medium haul configuration. 

The service from the crew throughout the flight was great and attentive and nothing was too much trouble. I had ordered their book the cook for dinner from the menu available online and it was delicious but I was also expecting breakfast and they seemed a little surprised when I asked about it as they served other passengers. 

Seems on the 7-8 flight between Brisbane and Singapore you get a choice of dinner as soon as possible after take-off or breakfast shortly before landing which I wasn’t aware of but they did serve me a delicious breakfast when I asked about it.

The champagne and cocktails served in business class were really nice as was the small amenity kit you could ask for which came in a nice zippered pouch which came in useful after the flight on my trip.

The main issue I had was the seat itself I constantly kept bumping into the touch seat controls moving the seat and turning on and off the lights and TV screen which became annoying after a while, also I found the wing on the seat really made it hard to get a good view out of the window. The seat seemed to have plenty of storage but just wasn’t as comfortable for me as some other seats I have been lucky enough to fly in over the years.

Overall a pleasant enough flight which was on time.

"Travelled with Singapore on their premium economy service. This was supposed to be the industry standard and the photos looked great. 
Pre flight- this was ok, bag drop was to a specific lane but the promised priority boarding was poor, on the way out it was separated, bit at changing on the way back there was no separation between economy and premium.

Seats - I have been flying a long time, and the seats are the same width as the economy of 20 years ago. Still far better than current economy, but not brilliant. As some controls for the entertainment system were on the inside of the seat armrests, anything in your pocket would catch and operate them. They were comfortable enough but had an irritating headrest which kept sliding down, so they started in position but then slid down becoming uncomfortable.

Entertainment system- really good choices, BUT there are headphones provided which had special 3 prong fitting, so if you brought your own you can’t use them!! The headphones are average quality with little noise cancellation so making the whole thing pretty useless.

Cabin- on the A380 outward, the cabin was forward and was separated from economy and business by a curtain, with a dedicated toilet. On the way back in a 777-300 it was a small area which was separated from business but there was no separation from economy toilets were at the back of economy and generally had a long wait. The lack of premium benefits were clear from disembarking, as on the way out priority exit happened, but on the way back only business got off first.with everyone else lumped together, no premium aspect at all.

Service- This was perhaps the most disappointing, outward journey was not as good as any other airlines premium economy, or even Qatars basic economy. As was made clear, Premium was not in fact given any premium benefits, it was just economy with slightly bigger seats - even TUI did this better. Got off the flight outbound dehydrated, didn’t see much of any flight attendant after meal service.

Food - Book the cook was the only premium benefit here, everything else was the same as economy, right down to the wooden cutlery on the outbound journey. The food was ok. Not good, just ok. Again Qatar and TUI did this MUCH better.

Summary- Double the price for slightly bigger seats and a quick bag drop. That’s it. 
Interestingly Scoot plus was significantly better in all departments, which is supposed to be the economy arm of Singapore airlines!

I would suggest using another airline, Premium does not mean premium on Singapore, they have not got the balance right. I find it ridiculous that the service and product from TUI which is a holiday company is far superior than the supposedly industry leader. Not even close to Qatar…..

"Singapore Airlines generally have a reputation for providing excellent service, and so we booked a Premium Economy flight SQ308 from Singapore to London, on 18 September 2023. Prior to this flight, we took a Scoot flight Melbourne to Singapore, again in Premium Economy, which was excellent, sitting in seats 1A and 1B.

The Singapore Airlines flight was disappointing in a number of areas.
We were not offered a glass of champagne on boarding, no flight menu was offered, no amenities kit, and very sparse service of drinks, in plastic cups (not glass). We had pre-ordered meals, my wife’s meal was first given to another passenger who opened it, realized it wasn’t theirs, and returned it to the hostess, who then read the correct seat number and offered it to my wife, opened!
I had to request more wine during the meal, it was not offered.

All in all, a most disappointing flight. We have Premium Economy flights booked on our return journey, not really looking forward to those.

"I am writing this review because we travelled on from Singapore on an aircraft which had the older Singapore Airlines's business class seats and what a difference they are from the new ones. Wide, comfortable, plenty of places to store items, a solid table and a wide area in which the stretch legs.  The new seats are a step backwards as the seat was hard and uncomfortable, the table a folding affair, apart from a pocket near the legs which can't be accessed when the seat is in the lying position, there is nowhere to put items and the area to position legs is so narrow that it is only possible to lie on one side or on the back.

"Out of 4 recent business class flights between Europe and Australia I had problems with two, which made the journeys very uncomfortable and troublesome, and created other problems. They inappropriately dealt with both of them, according to me, on top of telling me things that turned out to be wrong, further showing unreliability of their claims.
In one case, my expensive “business-class” seat had no electric power at all, for a 12-hour flight (out of a 24-hour total flying trip with them) ; This, even though they knew it before the flight. So, no electric command was working: The electronic commands of the seat, so that I could not move the seat nor adjust its position or shape ; The headlights were also not working (so no real light when cabin lights were off) nor was the call button, so I could not even call the staff for any kind of assistance, but had to go and see them to ask for anything. This for 12-hours …
For this they offered a voucher of 200 Singapore$ (147 US$, 136 €) limited to purchase in their gift shop … Singapore Airline staff in two different locations, told me things that turned out to be false, resulting also in waste of time: That their customer service would contact me for this ; they didn’t. Then (the sales people, basically the only ones that I managed to call) that if I wrote, via their website (essentially the only real way to contact the customer service, since other claimed options didn’t work in practice and so were just a source of further waste of time), Singapore would answer “within 72 hours, maximum” ; They did after 1 month ... (perhaps thanks to a reminder I sent 12 days later). And this didn’t turn out to be very constructive either. 
This case shows how little they value customer’s comfort in business class (in spite of advertising the opposite) and customers' time. So does the 2nd case: we missed the connection between 2 SA flights, in Singapore, due to late 1st flight, but no assistance from SA, eg to reorganize our arrival, (resulting in waste of time and money). Except for having automatically rebooked us on a future flight, even though we could have just made it for the initially planned connecting flight, particularly since flying business class: we could have arrived at the departing plane 8 minutes before its closing door time ; I told the ground staff but they refused.
I asked whether European law (or similar Singapore law) would apply ; After 1.5 months they told me they are still reviewing the question ...   ",0.091,0.872,0.037,-0.967,0.7584788203239441,0.2180110216140747,0.02351013757288456,1
We had a 2hr delay for a flight which caused a different linked flight and we couldn’t choose our own seats. We paid fir the choosing of own seats but when we tried to complain about it got no where.

"The writer often travels on the kangaroo route and occasionally on regional flights in South East Asia - mostly for business reasons. 

In those years, SQ was in a league of their own. They had really delicious inflight meal, innovative entertainment System.. And lets not to forget the SIA girls in those day when they wholeheartedly served the guests with the highest standards ever seen- great care and high level of adaptability to the guests behaviours, and also their attention to details. 

Fast forward to today, where should I start?

SQ girls

Downright rigid and robotic, like IATA police. Chaotic crew management. When it was 45 minutes before landing, the cabin crew already began to diligently enforce all passengers to draw the window shades open and put seat back upright. And they will go around checking with such great efficiency that would have made Hitler proud. One crew member even asked me to take off the sq earphones for landing, and the plane hasn't descended. Some crew in red kabaya were a few times seen to talk down loudly at the junior crew to get something done. Truly shocking for the passengers around. I still haven't even touched on the topic on the vast disparity in the way they treat passengers of different races. 

Now come on, why are we forced to be so uptight with following the IATA rules? What's worse - they enforce the rules like a policeman. One can easily get the impression that SQ is institutionalising their past best practises. Every moves of the sq girls are subjected to ISO9001 audit! I can reveal that the crew do this much differently on other competing 5 star airlines!

Inflight meal-- absolutely horrendous, especially economy class meals. Regional meals replaced with bento box meals? Sure, the porridge taste OK. But the pasta and chicken rice don't. Pasta and vege were often overcooked when served. Haagen Daaz ice cream are gone. The wines taste cheap. 

Seats-- seats definitely feel harder and less comfy. On the 380 and 777, the Y seats are fine. They feel reasonably wide enough. But beware of their 787 dreamliner. Their Y seats are incredibly narrow. Many friends and family members commented the same to me. 

Inflight entertainment and WiFi
Do not be fooled by their seemingly many choices on offer. The movie choices seem good, but many top-rated Hollywood movies and Netflix Shows are missing. OK, they try to make up for it by adding the krisflyer login and playlist option. Sounds like a nice touch, but if guests aren't looking forward to your entertainment options on offer, who will bother? Even kids movies feel cheap. And now SQ is trying to win back frequent flyers by offering unlimited WiFi only to krisflyer members registered on this flight, but not to passengers redeeming miles on other frequent flyer programs. Yikes! Sound like a trap. 

Krisflyer
In general, award space availability for kf members have fallen. It also costs more miles to fly the same route as compared to other competing airlines. One glaring example is on the Singapore-Sydney route. I will leave it to you to do the research on the mile redemption costs. 

Overall, you can feel that SQ management is tweaking around with the onboard and on-ground experience in the face of greater financial pressure and competition. The overall experience feels cheaper, manipulated, and less premium than before, and they no longer justify the high airfare traditionally quoted by SQ. Standards have fallen. Frequent flyers loyalty deserves better elsewhere.

I am so glad that I switched my airlines loyalty.

"Phenomenon service is an understatement to this airline.
I have taken many trips with many different airlines over part decades but Singapore airlines definitely give me a different perspective what an airline or airline services should be.
They are very attentive, attention to details and very professional. On this trip, we took some of our trips with business class and some with economy. Both class provided exceptional services.
One of my meals, from Singapore back to Newark, steak with oxtails and vegetables was one of my most delicious meals to remember. Man oh man, it was one of the best meals I have ever had on air.  I usually have low regards for foods on air due to the atmospheric and pressure charges and taste buds changes but they managed make one of the most delicious steak that I have ever tasted in my entire life.  By the way, I'm a steal lover. They executed my steak dish to almost perfection. The steak was medium, my favorite. The shredded oxtails was tasty, tendered and melt in your mouth. The veggies were perfectly cooked.  One of the gentlemen gave me two different glasses of wines afterwards,n per my request, and they were great also. I gave my honest compliment to the gentleman who served my wines  and he brought the chef over to thank my compliment.  What a service!  I regret I didn't take the picture of my steak plate. 🤦‍♂️

Business class were located on the upper deck I was seated in 93A greeted by ISM and senior purser before taking off,  standard greeting nothing much.
It was a 1-2-1 configuration but I didn’t like the fact that the leg test is on the side so basically when you lower the seats or if you were to sleep you have to shift your entire body cuz the chair is fixed, weird design
Pre ordered their signature ho fun didn’t taste good it’s a little bitter as if it’s over cooked, fish was too dry, nothing like the actual keng Eng kee ho fun

"Singapore airlines neglected to confirm my seat on their partner airline so I missed my flight because the gate agent wouldn't let me board (I was able to make it through security and check my bags). 

When I called Singapore Airlines support to resolve this they told me they could ""offer"" a rebooking for an additional $400 and a lower service class. So not only did they force me to reschedule a flight, they downgraded me and made me pay extra for the downgrade. AND I was never reimbursed for the difference of the economy/premium economy ticket.

"Originally booked a flight through Singapore airlines for my mother in law to fly from Melbourne to Frankfurt, several hours before her departure the Singapore to Frankfurt flight got cancelled. I spent a couple of hours on the phone talking to both Lufthansa and Singapore airlines to organise the re-booking of her flight, i was bounced back and forth between the two trying to organise it before she had to check in from Melbourne.

The calls took so long i made it to Melbourne airport and instead talked to the service desk and asked about the cancellation and they said it will sorted by the time she arrived in Singapore. Her direct flight got switched out for a Singapore -> Delhi -> Amsterdam -> Frankfurt.

After receiving the email of the change only half an hour before her landing at Singapore i tried to talk to Singapore airlines to her a replacement direct flight as due to medical and language barriers she would not be able to navigate the multiple stopovers.

Two hours on the phone got me nowhere and apparently every flight was booked for the destinations from Singapore to either Munich, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Brussels, London or even back to Melbourne at which point a family member would be able to her get to her original destination without the insane amount of stopovers.

The staff just kept insisting there is no available flights even for the day after her arrival in Singapore.

I have flown so many business class airlines in my time but never before with SA. Not only was the business lounge of the very poorest class I've ever seen but the actual aircraft was tired and old. My business class seat was sticking and the stewardess nearly injured her back trying to get it to move into its sleep position. The sewing on the seat was actually frayed - very old and tired. However this wasn't the worst  - as my husband while away -  had a severe spinal injury which meant that I had to try and have tickets reissued not once but several times as he had two very severe relapses necessitating emergency spinal surgery and months of rehabilitation. SA Customer Service were absolutely useless. Half the time - even with my flight details in front of them - they couldn't figure out the pattern of flight re-issues and each time even though it was obviously a medical emergency and could be verified at the highest level - they gave no help with the rebooking fees or the astronomical amounts required to rebook a ticket - the difference from the original ticket price and the re-issue price. I ended up paying for my business ticket twice over in the space of 6 months. Absolute exploitation of a customer who has no other options. We will never fly with them again and when I reported my concerns with this issue I was met with a very lacklustre response and a barrage of policy documents. There was not one person at SA who took any ownership of the situation.,0.15,0.813,0.038,-0.9867,0.9160009026527405,0.07457832247018814,0.009420807473361492,1
"I needed to use all my accrued points that were about to expire from not being able to travel during the last 2 +years of Covid.

The process of trying to get a flight was 100% manual, i.e. calling in to speak with an associate, and relying on the associates to verbally relay to you what flight is available.  The website and app do not work.  I have been playing with it for a long time. I consider myself to be a tech. savvy user.  

I had to call 4 times, and finally actually got the mileage redemption ticket via United associates who were able to identify the mileage redemption class ticket on Eva Air for me.  Shame on KrisFlyer team!

"We used SQ  875 from Hong Kong to Singapore for transit  and SQ 964 from Singapore to CGK international airport in Indonesia, This is used to be the best Airlines. First of all it was delayed for 3 hours at the Hong Kong Airport with no air conditions in the mid of Summer in Hong Kong. The AC was on after the plan started to move. This delayed cause us to missed our connecting flight in Singapore. Arrive in Hong Kong again we had to wait inside the airplane for 45 minutes due to technical problems again with no air conditions. Now because of that we are booked on the next flight in which of course being 2 hours late, it is a good thing that are in side Changi Airport. The airport is not that great like people saying. Hong Kong new airport and Doha international airport is way better than Changi. I have to tell you about this airport too. Now after being 2 hours late they told us to go to Gate 69 in which we wait patiently with the other passenger and crew. Long behold on the boarding time, a staff came and spoke to the crew and the crew announced that the gate was changed to Gate 29. That is a 40 mins walked with no official announcement. By the way at Gate 29 it will still say SQ  964 and the official airport announcement  board is still on Gate 69. This is the worst airlines experience that we had, this is way worst than Lion Air or Pakistan International Air. Singapore Airlines make these airlines looks way better. So we cancelled our return flight and only got 50% back after all of the fine, currency exchange etc even though we cancelled it 3 weeks before our returned flight.

"Had the most horrific dealings with Singapore airlines check in manager at Changi airport, firstly my wife is registered as disabled and my wife and i are both in our 60's.
We booked extra legroom seats because of my wife's disability and returned from Singapore to London Heathrow on flight SQ306 on Monday 29th May 2023, we had a really upsetting and stressful experience after we boarded the flight, this was also witnessed by the cabin crew who have submitted a separate report by leading steward Benjamin Khoo.
The problem was caused by the boarding gate manager in Singapore, we boarded at gate 9.
The first issue was that the seats we had booked were 31A and 31C in premium economy were emergency exit seats and we were told that we would have to be moved because of my wife's mobility issues, this was fine and we were allocated seats 32H and 32K, we were taken to the gate (my wife in a wheelchair) and boarded with no issues and got settled into our seats for the long 13 hour flight home.
Obviously the people who were originally in the seats that we moved to were offered the free upgrade for the extra legroom seats we had originally booked, this is where the problems started.
One of the passengers ( a male in his late 20's early 30's  )who was moved was not happy with the free upgrade and there was obviously a lot of discussions taking place which we could witness from where we were seated but did not know the content of, eventually the check in manager entered the plane ( the same man who gave us our new seats ) and after a few minutes of talking to the man in his 20's / 30's came over to where we were now settled and said that the man was not happy with his new upgraded seat and wanted his original seat back, he ordered us to move to seats 33F and 33G which were middle aisle seats, i told the manager that my wife needed to get up and move around to stop her seizing up, but he was not interested and said move or he would have us escorted from the plane, he was extremely rude and arrogant and was not interested in my wife's disability and the pain it then caused her to move again, he was more interested in letting a fit and able young man have his original seat back. this exchange was witnessed by multiple passengers and crew, the lady who was moved with this young man was not happy either and would have been happy to stay in her upgraded extra legroom seat, if this is the quality of management that Singapore airlines wish to employ we will never travel with Singapore airlines  again, this man has single handily destroyed my faith in Singapore airlines.

I emailed Singapore airlines on our return and received a reply which blamed the crew on the plane, i replied telling them the facts again but received no reply, i have tried contacting Singapore airlines a few times and have given them plenty of time to reply but now is the time to tell the world just how Singapore airlines deal with disabled passengers.

"We booked return business class flights to Europe on flexible tickets.

It was then necessary for us to change the Sydney Paris leg to Sydney Istanbul on a later date.
The ticket conditions stated ""Booking change fee Complimentary (a fare difference may apply)"" . We expected this fare difference condition to be applied in good faith.

Singapore Airlines imposed a 30% penalty for this change.

I questioned the Singapore Airlines staff on this 30% penalty in two regards

Firstly, we were changing to a shorter, cheaper flight, why was the cost increasing?
* Flight Time for Singapore Paris is 13h 35m.
Flight Time for Singapore Istanbul is 11h 0m
* The fare for Sydney Paris is AUD7792.39-8217.25
The fare for Sydney Istanbul is AUD 6342.59 at the time we proposed the change to the booking.

Secondly, part of this change is that an airfare Singapore Paris on 26 Aug is now made available for sale by Singapore. The price of this fare is higher than the Istanbul fare which would be taken off the market by our change. So as well as charging an extra 30% for the outward bound leg of our journey, Singapore profit further by the higher sale price of that Paris fare. Singapore may well say that they might not sell this fare. Perhaps, but they also may not sell the Istanbul fare.

Despite interactions with many many Singapore Airlines staff, not one person ever answered the issues raised, or in any way ""owned the problem""

To make matters worse the Singapore Airlines representative proudly told me there was ""no penalty"" for the change in booking. In such case why the 30% charge for changing to a cheaper flight ?

So while I understand “revenue maximisation models” I also understand concepts of acting in good faith with customers. How does this latter concept factor in their penalty ? Singapore Airlines talks with pride about the experience it provides to people who fly with them. The process we are going through now is part of that experience. All we were looking for is that people act in good faith and with fairness.

These practices should really be reviewed by Australia's consumer protection authorities. The statement ""Booking change fee Complimentary (a fare difference may apply)"" is clearly grossly misleading. That should be our next step.",0.073,0.822,0.106,0.9189,0.5026800036430359,0.43779653310775757,0.05952344462275505,1

I spent 2.5 hours on the phone to Singapore Airlines customer service costing hundreds of pounds trying to resolve the issue, only to be told that the airline aren't going to do anything else for us, to rebook a new flight for 3 x the price originally paid, and hung up the phone.
 
When I returned to the UK my complaint was escalated to R. Bartlett in the UK complaints team, who failed to review the complaint in detail, disregarding majority of the information I provided.

"This was the worst flying experience we have ever had. It started with a chaotic and uncontrolled boarding at the Changi Airport. There was absolutely no checking of the tickets or seating. Boarding was more like a stampede. Flight was delayed for around half an hour for a technical reason. In a Premium Economy class for dinner we were only served with a slice of soggy, tasteless, stuck to a paper cardboard, pizza. After that, during night, there was no service whatsoever. We were sitting in the first raw, on the side, unfortunately right next to the storage compartment that the crew members were constantly using, mostly for their own personal things. Door opening and closing, read banging, was going on for the whole night. Seats were uncomfortable, making sleeping difficult and hardly any better than in Economy Class. Throughout the night it was very cold and the given thin blankets were rather useless. There was no free wifi also.
For breakfast there were 2 choices of food and both were of very poor quality. Neither for dinner nor breakfast did we have cloth napkins.
On disembark from the airplane we were directed towards Economy door.

"The expectations for a five-star airline are always high and this review reflects our high expectations vs the reality we experienced on our recent flights BOM-SIN-BKK:

THE PROS

1 Cabin crew: highly motivated & upbeat. Excellent ambassadors of SIA.

THE CONS

1 Aircraft B777W: a noisy aircraft (when sitting next to the engine, 18 A). Avoid!
2 Seat: if you love sitting in an angled position during take-off and landing, go for it! The captain switched off the seatbelt sign 45 min into the flight due to heavy rains in India and 30 min before landing, a back ache as a result. The bed is comfortable, though, managed some 1-hour sleep on the flight.
3 Meal: didn't book the cook. Very spicy ex-Mumbai.
 
When flying a five-star airline and spending a small fortune after Covid-19 for the flights, the expectations are really high. Those were not met by SIA, unfortunately, partly due to the poor transit experience at Changi Airport (i.e. T2 under renovation, T2 lounge poor). SIA seems to be OK the air, but poor on the ground at present (T2 in particular).

"Well where to start. My wife and I were travelling with our 2 children 1 and 7yrs old from Per to Lax return, mid Feb....yes I know, we took our little ones on business but for the most part they were good kids. Notably the 1 year old is slugged almost $1000 to be in business class, nothing more, and the 7 year old is slugged full fare ~7k. (Not whinging about that, just adding the details for those who may be curious.)
So ill shave alot of the issues out and just provide the good stuff. 
From the moment you arrive at the Perth broom closet also known as the Singapore airlines lounge, you find yourself thinking hmmm ok, maybe emerates would have been worth the extra 10k. The Perth lounge for Singapore is or at least should be embarrassing for the company.  It's more dr waiting room, where everyone starres at each other and of course there is zero ambience. No music No nothing, just the sounds of people going to the toilet in the background....after they have cued for the only single toilets available of course. 
Once settled .....Into standing around, because there are no seats, you find yourself wanting a 5am coffee, however of course there is only 1 lady working on what can only be described accurately as a coffee cart, by herself....as Friendly she is though,.there is one cart surrounded by over 150 people...you couldn't dream up a funny script like this if you tried and of course, this is real. Don't worry it gets sooooo much better.

We decide to leave the broom cupboard and wait amugst the masses for a cuppa (not bad for a 30k investment), and of course we had more luck seeing jesus walk on water before we got anywhere near the front of the coffee line....so no coffee. By now though, we have the most amazing backing tracks to compliment the seamless singapore airlines experience....yep.
you guessed right, the 1yr old was now performing some fine out of key opera, and to be honest, pre coffee in a 30k hole, I couldn't care less...sing my son, 
Let the airline hear your talent.....

As we step onto the plane, which did depart on time, we are quick to learn that the seats don't operate correctly.......ohhhhh goodness....this was meant to be a 20year anniversary gift to my wife.....really it's just a kick to her shins as this is off to a fine start......

So I hail the cabin manager who offers to tape the seat with....GAFFA TAPE. No joke, gaffa tape......We took photos because it was quite romantic and no one would believe us if we told them, loo so photos were a must. 

Set off in flight and safe to say, im hungry and looking forward to the 'book the cook'meals I pre ordered and recieved confirmation for....I mean seriously, what could go wrong considering, I pre planned so far in advance with so much excitement.....hmmmm, complete failure' I actually never recieved a meal. Once everyone was finished, I though, struth, I better ask these clowns where my meal is....I was told I never ordered anything, even though I showed them my book the cook confirmation receipt from the Singapore airlines app. 
That's OK though, I'll settle for a coffee. It's not like a paid for a premium service or anything, so I quickly readjusted my expectations 😮‍💨...

You know, I could continue on with this review but im certain it will either be ignored or fall on def ears, so I wont bore you all with the many further issues on each leg of thr trip, however I can assure you the rest of this trip was terribly remarkable in a horrible sence, with problem after problem, coupled with arrogant, horroble cabin crew service for the.most part. There was a real sense that the crew thought they were the the best out there and our concerns were insignificant.....as I point to the gaffa tape lol for example.

So an update post flight, I write this review early July where I've just called the company to simply ask they provide me and my family our business reward points we were entitled to having paid a small fortune....... BUT of course I've been given the run around and told that my account is dormant and therefore the points won't be allocated unless I make a new account. 
That would be fine if it was an old account, but I created the account beginning this year, pre flight.....the company truly is shonky.

Summary: look as you can probably see reading this review, there are a few take away points, amongst many. For me most notably, is whilst Singapore's prices appear on the face of it to be better priced, there is clearly a reason for it. 

I don't dispute anyone who states they had a good experience with the airline and that I'm full of it....thats fine, but those people saying thst may not be payong in excess of 30k for their fligyts either.....however what I would caution is that this story of horror is actually true. It's not embellished or a joke, it's sadly true. This story sits In isolation of course but none the less it's a true story so it should make.someone second guess any thought of paying big money with this mob, considering at no point can you drop.in and sepwk to someone and get thr issues fixed and reviewed. All you can do is call the call centre as I have, and discuss the issues on all 4 flight legs with Singapore that were just terrible. 

Now if you snag a great economy fare and it's just you and a partner then fine, you roll with the punches, BUT if you are looking to pay in excess of 30k in flights for something special, it may be better to go with an airline that will deliver. An airline that cares about their reprutation and the implications of their poor sevice and how it impacts others. 

It was our choice to spend this much I know, but the cautionary tale is still there for Any prospective people wanting to treat themselves moving fwd....id say avoid singaapore airlines for special occasions/business. 
I'd be happy to answer any questions from any one considering the same venture, as i wouldn't wish our horrible experience with sinagapore airlines, upon anyone. 

They ruined our special anniversary and STILL can't be of any help to us, simply fixing our missing points. Very dissapointing, never again.

"I used to think Singapore Airlines was worth the price difference, but this is getting harder and harder to justify.

Trying to earn miles is also made frustrating. If you pay for a couple tickets with the same cards, your miles are split across two passports, because forbid it that families travel together.

"Singapore Airlines is trying very hard to be the best airlines in the world. 
Probably it only applies to First Class.

First of all, inflight meals of economy class were terrible.  And I’m trying to reclaim my miles of my flight from SFO to YVR. (I booked that flight on SQ official homepage), Air Canada is the Star Alliance and SQ partner.
The first stfaff (VK) replied me that “we will not be able to add miles for your Air Canada flight”.
He has no knowledge that Air Canada is SQ partner.
I  told him that Air Canada is SQ partner airline and shows him a screenshort of my my KrisFlyer account,  the claim missing miles page shows AC (Air Canada) is SQ airline partner and is able to choose to claim for missing miles.
Then the 2nd staff asked me to attach all the documents to reclaim my miles. 
I’m still dealing with them and so far they have all different staff to reply me. (Aleady dealed with four different staff already).

I think Singapore Airlines can do better than this. This is such a disappointment with the Airlines that chosen as the BEST in 2023.

"Travelled on Singapore Airlines with my husband and almost two year old twin daughters from Brisbane to Munich. Before leaving Australia I had called customer service to request that all our meals be made dairy free (including my two year old daughters). I was informed that I would be able to request this online. I made this request about two weeks prior to leaving; however, once on board our first flight from Brisbane to Singapore flight crew informed me that there were no dairy free meals available for our daughters. The flight crew tried to make a request for our next flight from Singapore to Munich but again there was no food available for them on this flight. I had packed back up food for them, but it is obviously difficult to travel over 35 hours with substantial meals. For these two long haul flights my daughters pretty much ate crackers and fruit the entire time. Crew on board told me to call customer service again before leaving Germany to ensure there would be dairy free meals for our flight back to Australia. 
I called Singapore Airlines two days before leaving Germany and was reassured that meals were already requested for my two daughters and that they would definitely be dairy free. Wouldn't we be surprised when the exact same thing happened. There was absolutely nothing they could eat. Flight crew told me that maybe customer service had misunderstood.

Upon arriving home, I emailed Singapore Airlines to make a written complaint. Their response was that we had apparently changed seats on one flight and therefore the meal went to someone else (even though we had specifically asked for our meals, and crew told us there were none). They also informed me that i would have needed a doctors letter for these meals. This was the first time anyone had mentioned needing a doctors letter. Frankly, there handling of the whole situation is appalling and there have been non-stop excuses made for them failing to provide food.

I've flown them many times before but definitely won't be again. ",0.062,0.848,0.09,0.91,0.7100947499275208,0.25353139638900757,0.036373820155858994,1
"So airlines occasionally lose luggage. It is annoying but it happens. It is the response to losing luggage that truly shows how good an airlines coroner service is. 
Unfortunately for a friend of mine, Singapore Airlines has failed dismally. 

Singapore Airlines lost the suitcase with all her belongings en route to Darwin. 

After making a report the item was missing the airline kicked into action and told her it had likely been identified. 

Ok, good news right? Er, no. Singapore Airlines has now held on to the bag for four days. Each day we go through the hassle of chatting with a robot until we convince it to allow us to contact a human, who assures us that we will receive a call back. Each day the call never comes. 

The baggage service only says that the case is ""pending"" with no explanation as to what pending means. 

Will the bag ever be released by the airline? Why haven't they brought it to Australia yet? Are they lazy? Is it too expensive?

There must be some reason. 

Anyways, in a nutshell: avoid Singapore Airlines if you can. They seem great when things go right. But when things go badly they go terribly badly and there is no-one at the airline willing to help.",0.174,0.691,0.135,-0.8606,0.7837134003639221,0.18147410452365875,0.03481249511241913,1

"Is there a score less than terrible? Currently traveling. Lost my bag. Was not put on my plane, it was sent to Narita and then to Montreal instead of Singapore. No updates over the past 6 days. Called customer service and lost baggage every day. Still to find someone in SIA who cares. Bag has now been in Montreal for 3 days without moving. I now enter into my second week traveling with no luggage, clothes, meds, supplies….

Find it hard to believe they were voted best airline. I have had better experiences on EasyJet. I only know where my bag is as it has an AirTag in it. SIA has no idea where it is, even with me telling them. It has not moved for 3 days….no one cares

Have asked for them just to send my bag home and I will get it there. But again no updates or action. I have asked what I can claim for my expenses….clothes luggage etc….but again they are quiet end will not confirm.

"We flew Singapore Airlines to US of A from India . To  be precise from Chennai to San Francisco and back with flight  change  both ways at  Changi airport in Singapore.We had done some preliminary research of the other airlines too but this one had higher customer approval ratings.

In the parlance of the the new age flyers, Economy  is often known as  cattle class.Some justification may be seen in that description when one surveys the boarding time scenario. Passengers in  this class  are herded towards the boarding gate  like cattle through a checkpoint where each one is examined and scanned for carrying just one cabin baggage and a valid boarding pass .  As the herd enters the aircraft they need to fall in line and walk past the superior class section to the cramped  narrow aisle way into the economy class section where they start looking for their assigned seats. After finding it they manage to squeeze their usually overstuffed cabin baggage in an already usually overstuffed over head compartment before strapping themselves in their seat.These manoeuvres often block the progress of their fellow passengers who must wait patiently till the path is cleared. If there happens to be any irate passenger in the waiting line a scuffle could erupt if the passengers are a family and took too much time to settle down . I and my family  did block the line but  managed to keep the delay short and avoided such a possibility.

The space in front and sides of my seat , as I foresaw ,was cramped as I sat down and straitjacketed myself . I had very little space to move my limbs freely although the seats were cushioned and soft . As always the hand rest in this class had to be shared with one's neighbouring passenger who incidentally were no strangers to me. They were my own family members .  The speaker socket and the control handset were all tucked around the inner part of my seat.Without the necessity to move this way or that I managed to get access to these .Thanks to  my grand daughter ,seated on my left, who managed it for me.

The plight of an occupant of such a seat is best compared to that of a sardine stuffed in a can . A living human being  however ,is more demanding  than  dead sardines and requires space, and lots of it, for real comfort but unfortunately  today's airline economics is based on space conservation as priority. All others are secondary, although this is not spelt out in so many words.In simpler words, ""They dare not throw away space generously at the going rate of economy airfares"" - and remain flying.  Comfort, therefore is  compromised by  re-interpreting it  as minimum discomfort and that makes all the difference in defining the present day economy class . Increasing the size of the seat a  few inches more  and adding fancy devices like the  footrest and including an extra item or two in the food menu, the economy  becomes premium economy class with little or no added value at an extra cost , unless provided gratis by the airline itself, which incidentally they did for us for our return journey.  Other airlines, I believe, are no different from this airline  in this kind of space and seat management in this class.

To survive the cut throat competition  more innovative measures are necessary to keep an airline flying. Singapore Airlines have devised a path breaking  strategy in this direction admirably. They have  unleashed  a  team of  well trained flight crew inside the cabin . This unique team of select male and female members slim and trim in build and nimble in negotiating through the narrow aisle and row space and a polite to a fault and soft speaking voice often bend over backwards to please the passengers  to make them feel at home and wanted in their aircraft. Over and above this first step  they have  added a choice menu of delicious  sounding airline food and a huge range of flight entertainment material that can keep you awake on long haul flights ,that is , if you cannot manage your sleep  in the cramped position .  Hey presto ! They  have broken some barrier and soon started flying far higher than their rivals with sky high reviews to boot.

Being a heavy set man, my own estimate of minimum discomfort level  was far higher than that of the aircraft designers and this was a serious disadvantage for me .The tray table ,the kind that drops down from the seat in front and the retractable one that is drawn out from the hand rest never fail to rest on my belly at an inclined angle. During meal times the food tray needs to be held with my left hand to prevent it from slipping away while feeding myself with the right. it cannot be a comfortable  position to enjoy any kind of food.  One could  probably do with an additional hand or two to hold on to the polythene / paper wrappers etc from flying all over the cabin while busy eating. Thanks to both my left and right helps they lent theirs . These are minor issues and turns major only to the oversized passenger concerned . An airline cannot be expected to look into this kind of individualistic problems,except perhaps suggest an upgrade to Business class.

As for the entertainment material ,they were  insipid for me, probably because of my outdated preferences but quite a treat to the majority of my fellow passengers around me.  Again an individualistic problem for which the airline cannot be blamed.In all fairness I must add they did have provision to add one's own entertainment material in the system .

Of the four stretches I flew from Chennai to San Francisco and back  , the onward journey from Chennai to Singapore and there on to San Francisco was relatively less strenuous than the return journey. The stretch from San Francisco to Singapore was  upgraded to premium economy by Singapore Airlines itself at no extra cost as mentioned above . I don't have much to rave about the premium economy as compared to the economy sections. The minimum discomfort level was probably higher than the economy class. Blame my bulky build I must remember not to forget I am unfit for cattle and start thinking of business  for all my future flying plans. I should also not forget  that all air lines follow  equation between comfort and minimum discomfort and this could well be a hidden factor in classes other than economy too.

The flight to Chennai from Singapore, the last stretch , was memorable for the wrong reasons. It was an ageing aircraft.  This was quite apparent when I took my seat because the tray table in front of me was quite clear of my belly and the  space availability  was  also more than the other newer aircrafts we had flown earlier. My amateur deduction was confirmed when the plane took off with a resounding plane shattering noise and vibration that lasted for several minutes during and after take off .No one seemed to be concerned. Least of all the crew  and everyone ignored it as if it was a normal phenomena. It could  be due to a bad weather take off because weather did seem inclement even during mid flight. However  the very  same noise and vibration occurred during landing in Chennai where the environment appeared normal. Age perhaps was telling.

Catering in this flight was executed in a haphazard  manner.Meal trolleys were absent and food trays were carried by hand by the crew member moving from galley to passengers several times and served at random order. The food was  below par but we ignored both the service and the food quality. We were reaching home and I was looking forward to it more than anything else

The final  hours of the flight was amusing. The pilot probably forgot to switch off the seatbelt sign after a brief period of turbulence during mid-flight and a steward who appeared to be a novice, prevented passengers from using the toilet pointing to the seat belt sign every time some one stood up looking towards the toilet. A few intrepid passengers  defied his instructions  when he was not looking and started walking towards the toilet. Several others followed suit and the line lengthened  and remained so for the next one hour till the captain announced the flight was starting the descent. During this period one of the senior stewardess was kind enough to help my ageing wife skip the line to a toilet ,probably intended for the crew.

The incident of using an ageing aircraft, the haphazard meal service and the unending toilet queue with a trainee crew member who was learning his ropes is indicative of indifferent attitude to this particular flight. There could be a very good reason for this but who wants to know. Not me. But the airlines  management probably know.

 I have been flying economy and business since 1968 in various airlines in various parts of the world and the term cattle class was unknown or was non-existent those days.  Economy those days could be  compared to business today. I have no comments on the economics of airline operations then or now  . I leave these to the experts to figure out the decline.",0.067,0.839,0.095,0.9941,0.3417689800262451,0.5374566912651062,0.1207742914557457,4
"I paid extra to get the forward seating section in economy just after premium economy. 
There was an empty row behind me and I was about to put my seat down as the seat in front of me put hers down so making my face pretty close to her head rest.
When I was lowering the back of my seat suddenly I felt someone pushing back at me . I looked back and there were 2 passengers from the regular economy section occupying the empty row behind me that were not their assigned seats.
I have no problems people switching seats but are they supposed to cause problems for passengers in their assigned seats trying to sleep on red eye flights? 
The unfriendly passenger insisted on pushing back at my seat every chance she gets making my 18 hour long haul back home super uncomfortable . For this I took away a point from Singapore airlines that has been my to go airline whenever I go to Singapore .

This review is for a return journey.  We flew the Brisbane Singapore route on the A350 900 regional aircraft and the A380 on the Singapore London route.  The regional aircraft is very comfortable in both sitting and lying.  We were not as comfortable in the A380.  Sitting up straight and lying down was okay but lounging was very uncomfortable with a seam in the seat that ground into one's coccyx. We had window seats mostly and they  felt very private.  The staff were exceptional as always on all flights and the bathrooms were kept clean and tidy.  The choice of food was best from Book the Cook and there was an excellent wine choice.  Speciality coffees are welcome.  We unfortunately heard criticism from other passengers when we were delayed boarding on one flight.  I do think we need to be more generous and understand the world is still getting back on its feet since COVID-19.  Thank you Singapore Airlines.

Somehow the lunch was served at 14.30 pm. When asked why had the lunch been so late, one of the air stewards replied ""oh...we are following Singapore time!"" 
Are you kidding me? The whole passengers were flying out FROM SYDNEY, not from Singapore.  Wny would the lunch be following Singapore time?
If there had been a problem, just admit it, not lying with such ridiculous and lame excuses.  My next passenger also said that he had also noticed that SIA had become so poor.  Their tickets are much more expensive than other airlines, yet their services had been so much cut down. Profit over passenger's comfort I suppose. Apart from that, I just learned that after Covid, SIA quality in everything had dropped so much.

"Paid $500 for a premium economy update. Was not worth it. Headrest on seat was broken and wouldn't go up. Footrest and seat both designed for short people and useless and uncomfortable for someone 183cm tall. Footrest spring and wouldn't support my legs anyway. Uncomfortable and not worth the money. Poor sleep compounded by cabin service - see below.

Infotainment worked well but screen was offset in my seat and so far away the screen was effectively tiny.

Checkin was painless albeit clunky on a smartphone with a pre smartphone era process.

Onboarding was bizarre in surabaya with an attendant using a poor quality belt amplifier and microphone to blare incomprehensible instructions at passengers. 

Boarding the a380 and then waiting 20mins for take-off was very slow- downside of a large plane most probably. Egress and baggsge was also slow probably also due to the size of the aircraft.

There was no food choice from surabaya as the better smelling option ran out. The laksa was average but the included bread roll was gross and tasted like it was full of sugar and preservatives and baked a week ago. The cake was also sickly sweet. Would have preferred some healthy food although a meal order may be a way to achieve this.

Order of serving passengers was also seemingly random on both flights. Waited 10 mins while passengers in front, beside and behind were served and yet others were waiting.

Most irritating part of the a380 flight was being knocked and brushed against by the stewardess 20 times for an overnight flight without leaning into the aisle significantly.

"I had premium economy ticket sold by Finnair, from syd to bud and return. However the system warns there's no premium economy onSQ0231  this experience was even worst than plain economy on Finnair. 

My SEAT was 71B, no choice as it's a Finnair ticket. There was a very loud continuous noise from the ceiling above, not just bothering, but really loud mechanic noise! Like a fan or something, during the whole flight! 

Very uncomfortable and dirty seat, no legroom, and even less space under the seat.

No food choices, no drinks  only a 100 ml for the dinner in a mini plastic cup and same before landing, you get 1 slice of pizza after take-off  and nothing else! 

7 hours and 20 minutes suffering, toilet stinks! Earplugs are rubbish, they put the opened one back.  slStewardesses just throw things to you and leave... dissappointing overall experience with the crew too.

The seat next to me 71A's electronic device did not work, so they restarted the whole row without telling a word, left us confused for 15 minutes what's happening. No lights or call button, or screen. 

Miserable flight after premium service on Finnair, and I don't know why they let this rubbish to add to their ticket, as it's nowhere neare to as good as Finnair.

"My return flight from dhaka to Adelaide. I found two options during booking. One is two segment flights DAC SIN ADL costing no extra but 17hrs layover in changi. Other option was three segments flights DAC SIN MEL ADL. No layover in Singapore but costing $162.xx more per tickets. I selected the three segments one. After 10 days they emailed, the last flight is delayed from Melbourne to Adelaide and now more delays than two segment flights. So I didn't accept their proposed change, went back to two segments flights. But they didn't refund the extra cost that was taken for the third flight. If they can find the partner flight issue with in 10 days of booking, that means they know this 10 days ago also but as they want to steal money from customers thats why they do not remove that booking option from website. The travel date is 5 months away. This is a trap, why I am saying this? Because same thing they did with my last travel this year as well.

My sister and our partners booked our flights for our family holiday 10 months before our trip so we could be on the same flights and get the window seats we always prefer. I booked business and my sister booked premium economy and our flights went via Singpaore with a one hour layover. A few months later Singapore took premuim economy off our flight and moved my sister and partner to a flight that them meant they had a 4 hour layover in Singapore and we had to purchase separate airport transfers. A short time after that they reinstated premium economy but DID NOT offer my sister and her partner their original flights/saets back. We have tried continuously to get them back on their original flights and Singapore have not helped at all. We have emailed and called. Obviously they do not care and are happy for our family trip to now cost more for transfers and inflict an uneccessary 4 hour airport layover onto passengers with NOTHING offered to make this situation better. The bare minium would be lounge access for the four hour layover but no nothing. It is not fair that I will board my flight and see the seats my sister and her partner booked and should be seated in only for them to be filled by others who booked much later than them!! Not fair Singapore Airlines! We travel Internationally at least twice a year but all our family will avoid Singapore Airlines because they do not show any semblance of caring.

"Pre Covid.  The A380 Suites are superb. The crew are attentive but discreet. As  regular 1st Class travelers, my wife and I would not dream of flying with anyone else.  The 777 flight Auckland to Changi is OK, the private room is a bonus while we wait for our next flight to Paris CDG on SQ's A380.  The suites and service 'WERE' incomparable. 
Mid Covid (June 2020). The A350 used on the Changi - CDG leg was frankly a disgrace.  It was old, tatty and dirty.  The crew were at their usual best.  The seat was uncomfortable and in need of new upholstery. This aircraft was a salute lesson on how to disappoint a customer.  However, we blame Covid.
Post Covid (June 2021 and 22).  Same awful aircraft, nothing has changed. Crew are still superb though. The purser on board whispers to me that lots of passengers are complaining.

"We are had a terrible experience with Singapore Airlines. They cancelled our flight SQ494 just as we landed from flight SQ860 and couldn't get to our destination on time. We were left us stranded at the Singapore airport for a full night, with no alternative arrangements or support provided. It was incredibly frustrating and stressful, and made our travel plans much more difficult than they needed to be.
 
To make matters worse, they also managed to lose our airline ticket from UAE to Morocco which we had to book at our own expenses in addition to a hotel booking in Dubai. This was a serious mistake on their part, and caused us a lot of additional stress and inconvenience. We had to spend extra time and money trying to sort out the situation, which was really frustrating.
 
Overall, I'm extremely disappointed with the service we received from Scout Airline and Singapore Airlines. It's unacceptable for an airline to cancel a flight and leave passengers stranded without any kind of support or alternative arrangements. And losing our airline ticket was a major mistake that caused a lot of unnecessary stress and hassle. I would not recommend these airlines to anyone based on my experience. And on top of that when we booked the flight we booked it through Singapore airline and no one from your company and airport wanted to help us out. 
  
Today, we have another flight from Singapore to Dubai SQ494, now we are requesting to speak to someone from Singapore Airline and are at Transfer B desk. The least you can do is to apologize and offer an upgrade in our flight, reimburse us for the additional fees spent and the stress caused health wise.

"I had trouble right from the  free online 48 hour check in phase. I selected seats and was rejected. So I rang and eventually spoke to someone who told me that I would have to pay to make these seat selections because I had already made selections. He would not accept that I had not made any previous selections and would not answer my question of why I would have to pay in the free 48 hour window. I told him that I did not want the seats that had somehow already been allocated to me - he then stated that the flight was full and no changes were possible. I asked to speak to his supervisor. She then stated that airline policy is to allocate seats 72 hours before departure. I then asked what was the point of the free 48 hour seat allocation process which is on the airline's website? No answer.
She finally agreed to send an email to some other department asking whether my wife could be seated in the aisle seat in front of me rather than next to me, because we both wanted aisle seats on a long (15 hour) flight. No mention of the flight being full. She promised that I would receive a response that evening.
Later, I received an email showing only me on the flight - my wife's booking had disappeared. I rang again, and was promised that she would be somewhere on the plane, but not necessarily near me. I stated that that was not good enough and that we wanted isle seats with her in front of me.
Again later that night, I received an email stating that she was now seated in an isle seat in front of me which is what we had requested. All good finally? NO. We got to the airport next morning, got our seat allocation tickets and my wife's seat was back next to me, not on the isle as stated. We asked whether this could be changed and were told all seats had been filled, including the promised seat in front of me. So we had been lied to both verbally and by email.
We then experienced the worst cabin service possible on the flight. We were second from the back and for some reason, were ignored when meals and liquid refreshments were issued. The cabin service seemed to start from in front of us. Eventually, we had to ask for the food and drinks that others had already received. The meals, once we had finally got them, were reasonable. That could not be said for the meals on the return flight from Vancouver to Singapore, then Singapore to Australia. They were almost inedible - mainly baked beans, some type of powdered egg and formed chicken which were barely even warm. We were told on both legs that they had run out of the popular meals, so we got what was left. If we had not been so hungry, we would have returned the meals. In addition, no drinks were served for the first 2 hours of the Singapore leg - again we had to ask for water.
I also found food scraps on my fold up table, from the previous flight. There was also a food stain on the seat. It did raise questions about whether the area had been cleaned after the end of the previous flight - it was definitely a health regulation breach.
So it seems to us that Singapore Airlines are trying to do things cheaply by reducing service and food quality levels, and quite prepared to mislead customers over seat allocation procedures when queried. They used to be our preferred airline, but given our experiences on this return flight, we will never fly with them again. We would urge anyone thinking of booking with them to try another airline.

I flew to Europe and back with Singapore Airlines in May 2023 and found their inflight service was almost no existence, the food was average and not much of it, good luck trying to get a after meal coffee. Inflight entertainment was too complicated and if you did find a movie you wanted to watch the supplied headphones didn't work very well so much so I couldn't make out half of what was being said.

"I recently traveled with Singapore Airlines on a trip from JFK to Bali, Indonesia in March 2023, reservation number 4DRFLW. As an avid traveler, I feel compelled to share my experience in order to provide an accurate account of my time with the airline.

To begin with, I opted for a coach class ticket, which turned out to be a regrettable decision. The seating arrangement in coach was extremely cramped, leaving very little legroom. The close proximity of the seats made it challenging to read or move comfortably, especially when the person in front reclined their seat. This often resulted in an uncomfortable experience, with their seatback practically on top of my knees, and I am only 5' in height. Even a simple trip to the bathroom became a cumbersome task, as I had to rely on holding onto the seats in front of me for support.

During our layover in Germany, my travel companion and I decided to upgrade to business class, which offered a considerable improvement in comfort and space. However, upon our return journey, we requested an upgrade to business class for the Singapore to Germany leg, but we were informed that we could only upgrade for the entire itinerary. This policy seemed inconsistent, as we were allowed to upgrade on our way to Bali. The lack of flexibility in this matter left us puzzled and dissatisfied.

Furthermore, I must express my disappointment with the attitude and behavior of the staff at Singapore Airlines. Throughout my interactions with them, I found them to be rude and unhelpful, which was surprising considering the airline's reputation. Curiosity led me to inquire about the experiences of my Asian friends who had traveled with Singapore Airlines in the past, and to my surprise, they echoed similar sentiments, sharing that they preferred non-Asian airlines due to concerns about service quality and aircraft standards. This realization only deepened my disappointment.

In addition, I found the process of dealing with Singapore Airlines' customer service to be daunting. Their staff appeared unable to think creatively or go beyond established protocols, which left me questioning their effectiveness and ability to address customer concerns.

It is important to note that my experience with Singapore Airlines encompasses merely the tip of the iceberg. While I understand that every airline can have its flaws, it is disheartening to encounter such issues with an airline of Singapore Airlines' reputation.

Based on my experience, I would advise fellow travelers to consider investing a bit more to ensure a better flying experience. While Singapore Airlines may have its merits, my encounter leaves me hesitant to recommend them wholeheartedly.",0.07,0.811,0.119,0.9457,0.7213564515113831,0.24700845777988434,0.03163507953286171,1

"Four flights - Brisbane to Singapore to Phuket and return.  Absolutely dreadful experience.  Still have PTSD from the final flight!  Firstly, the food trays in economy are not to be messed with.  They sit so low on the seat in front that when you open them out they sit on your stomach at an angle that allows the food/drinks to slide off.  Also no complimentary packs as was once the case.  I was looking forward to those little slippers they used to give you – nada - but that's ok because the seat in front of you is so close that to bend down to put them on you more than likely would give yourself concussion when your head hits said seat.  It also felt like they had managed to squeeze in another four rows of seats at the expense of comfort and ease for passengers. 

Food on all flights was inedible but the final flight's food (departed Singapore around 12.45 am) was non-existent - nothing was offered except water and juice until approximately 7 am when baked beans and an egg was served.  Who serves baked beans to a plane load of passengers? The toilets are busy enough without the added fibre of a baked bean meal.  Can't complain about the service because there was nothing to serve.  I really felt like I was flying with some sort of budget airline instead of one that I paid quite a bit of money for.  Singapore Airlines once had a fantastic reputation and I was looking forward to flying with them.  I certainly won't be flying with them again.

"Booked  return tickets for my family and i . Due to my daughter turning infant to child stage , i had to book a seperate ticket for her only for departure from TRV to SYD via SIngapore. Called customer service and booked a ticket through them .Paid extra for that . Got all details ,printed my e-tickets . 

Went to airport for going back to SYD after my holidays . Airport authority said there is no bookings shown in their system under the name of my daughter so we are unable to fly . We came to know about this while checking in . They send us home asking to contact singapore airlines customer care . I had the copies of my daughters return air ticket including the payment done

I called Customer care services and they said the system is showing that i had already flown . How can the system show that a passenger is flying in the aircraft even if that person hasn't checked in .They asked me to rebook the tickets and its again depends on seat availabilities .

"Have flown many times with Singapore Airlines over the last 14 years and have been extremely happy but not anymore. Flew Brisbane to Ho chi min then Singapore back to Brisbane May 2022. Seats extremely uncomfortable and so jammed in that I was unable to recline my seat at 2am on overnight flight as my seat was resting on the passenger behind. Food was so bad couldn't eat it. Only offered a drink at dinner time .
No breakfast was served , not even a glass of water prior to landing at 7am . No hot towels and no amenities packs.

"Just completed the 18 hour+ flight from Newark International Airport to Singapore. I have travelled from the States to Singapore many times, but have previously flown via United from Newark to San Francisco, and then SFO to Singapore. I decided to try the nonstop flight just to have the experience. Overall, it was as good as an 18- hour flight can be. Sitting in business class with the flat-bed seats was certainly worth the cost. The food was delicious and the movie selection was outstanding. I watched five movies (all recent releases), and as a result was throughly entertained for the first 9-10 hours of the flight. When I finally decided to go horizontal, the flight attendant helped to convert the seat into a bed and I was reasonably comfortable; my only complaint is that the flat bed configuration requires that you sleep on an angle, and there isn't a lot of room to maneuver on the bed. When you want to switch positions, you feel like you are on a rotisserie. However, the plus factors greatly outweigh the inconvenience of not being able to truly sleep comfortably when you are a very tall person. I also like the fact that the flight arrives into Singapore about 5:00pm, and during the summer--this is a plus (at least for me), since it is still daylight in Singapore and I felt that I had a few hours to be active before I crashed.  I don't think I will ever say that I am looking forward to a 18-hour nonstop flight, but if you have to fly from the US east coast to Singapore, it is the best way to go.",0.021,0.793,0.186,0.9946,0.0203123576939106,0.11935348063707352,0.8603341579437256,5
"Very slow and poor customer service from Singapore airlines. i flew from Johannesburg to Bangkok on 20/05/2023. upon arrival, i notice my luggage was damaged (the bottom of my bag was broken and the wheel broke off). I immediately contacted Singapore airlines for assistance. they replied with several different emails requesting documentation and pictures which i sent. I am flying back to Johannesburg tomorrow (29/05/2023) without a bag i can use for my luggage. Ive indicated the urgency to Singapore airlines but theres absolutely no regard for this. I will definitely not be flying with Singapore airlines again because of this poor service. The disregard is unbelievable. i will also be informing my company and other companies in our network to not use Singapore airlines for any of our staff going forward.

"Our first flight was   SQ 214   Perth to Singapore
We were disappointed with the Singapore Lounge at Perth Airport, it is extremely small, and quite dark.
The flight was nice and comfortable, the meal, the Chicken in Macadamia Nut Crust, we were very disappointed with, it was extremely  dry.

Our second flight was   SQ 026   Singapore to Frankfurt  
This flight was one of the worst I have been on.
My  Book the Cook order Roasted Lamb Rack - my Lamb Rack was one chop, a thick one, but one chop?
After eating my meal, I had a sleep. Upon waking I felt quite ill. I think it must have  been the food. Unfortunately I vomitted, all over myself. My husband called for help from the fight attendants. Two females appeared and the first question they asked me was what had I been drinking? All I had to drink on this flight was water -  if they paid attention to their customers - they should know this. I have never been so insulted in my life. I'm still so angry about this. The flight attendant came and suggested I wouldn't like to have breakfast - don't worry I wasn't going to anyway. There was no offer of any water or anything else.

Our third flight was    SQ 2062   Frankfurt to Madrid
This flight was with Lufthansa Airways. The flight was a short flight , unfortunately our luggage was held up for two days. This could not be helped by the flight crew. They could do with some help with communication. Instead the passengers were left waiting, trying to find out where our luggage was.  
 
Our fourth flight was   SQ377   Barcelona to Milan
This short flight was crewed by some of the best flight attendants we have ever come accross. We did not have any breakfast. We had eaten a big breakast in the Miro VIP Lounge. This was an excellent lounge, the food was wonderful. The staff on the plane were very attentive, and very engaging. Unfortunately the staff were changed when we got to Milan.

Our fifth flight was  SQ377    Milan  to Singapore
This flight was better than Sinapore to Frankfurt. There are some inconsistences that I would like to point out. The service my husband and I received was quite stark. He was offered bread or croissant with his breakfast, I was not. I was offered wine on boarding, he was not.    

Our sixth flight was  SQ223   Singapore to Perth
This flight suffered from the same as the flight from Milan to Singapore inconsistant service. I was also attended by the rudest gentleman I have ever encountered, he was extremely short with his attitude and would grab things out of my hand, I think this is unacceptable.  

I was so looking forward to this trip, unfortunately I was very disappointed.
I previously had two trips we had to cancel in the last five years, and I would like to thank Sinapore Airlines for the way they handled  the complete refund.
I think I was thinking the staff and service would be as exemplary as the staff handling the refunds.
I look forward to your reply.

"As I was flying from Tokyo to London, I actually took four flights in May. There is a lot I love about Singapore Airlines, but it really is dependant upon where you are sitting.
On my first flight from Tokyo to Singapore, I was lucky to book a bulkhead seat. Very comfortable and I got some sleep. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to book a bulkhead seat for the lengthier trip from Singapore to London. I was in the last row of an economy cabin and although I was lucky there was no one next to me, I felt very penned in spite of the plane being an A380 - especially when the passenger in front of me reclined. I have put on a bit of weight recently - that could be why, but I didn't feel that way a few months ago when I flew with Emirates on an A380. On the plus side, the cabin crew was lovely, the entertainment system was excellent and I chose the vegetarian Indian option - everything was very tasty.

On my way back, I think I hit the jackpot! I was in the second row of economy with the no bulkhead seat in front of me. No one was in the row beside me and I slept very well. As it was a late night flight I opted for no dinner - even so the the cabin attendants were very attentive and made sure that I wasn't hungry and was well hydrated. One of the best flights ever.

Unfortunately, the trip from Singapore to Tokyo felt - again - very cramped. I was very hungry by that stage and was surprised that on a seven hour flight, there was only one meal served - which was quite later on into the flight. A snack of some kind would have been very welcome.

If I can make sure I get a bulkhead seat or fly in Premium Economy I would definitely use Singapore Airlines again. Although the stopover time in Singapore was very long, the flights were very reasonably priced. A bit of a mixed bag but the service was universally good.

But if my budget stretches I may choose Emirates next time I fly.",0.057,0.775,0.168,0.9933,0.049501724541187286,0.19097183644771576,0.7595264315605164,3
"I can see from the reviews that Singapore airlines is not what it used to be in terms of customer service and communication they are atrocious!
been trying to get a refund for over a year since March 2022.
1st of all they changed my flight so I said i can not use that flight tried several times on the website to comminicate about it and it was so difficult and response times up to 15 days! finally I had to go to Jakarta to a Singapore airlines office to speak to someone. They acknowledged and accepted my claim but said I can just call to make a new flight resevation at a later date. During that time trying to speak to someone over the phone was impossible. Huge wait times I mean over an hour. I gave up. This year I requested a refund and I received an email saying I would get the refund within 6 weeks? this is after a year had gone by. Still waiting for the refund 6 weeks late no confirmation it had been refunded. I wrote again notifying the airline my email address had changed which I did through the Singapore airlines FF portal on the website. you have to go through a security text message to verify its you to do this. Then I get another email saying they need to verify who I am  and I need to send all the information again. OMG sooo Frustrating! Still waiting! I am wrting this review because of my frustration. I will not use this airline agian and want to warn others about my experience. This was business class flight & I am a Gold star alliance member.

During a recent flight back from Osaka-KIX, the meal tray really look embarrassing for a top notch airline.

"My wife and I flew Singapore Airlines Economy, return from Singapore to Perth.

One slight annoyance: - when I booked these flights back in December, I had some problems using our Krisflyer points and so contacted Singapore Airlines customer services who completed the booking for me.  Subsequently I was charged 68 SGD – around £41 – which was initially explained as a credit card fee.  Having challenged this, the charge was eventually explained as a service fee applied when using customer services to make a booking.

It also appears that you have to ask for a second drink as I was never offered one. Tea and coffee are in short supply as well.

"If there was an option for no stars, I would select that.

Singapore Airlines from Bangalore, India to Singapore which was set to depart at 0120 was delayed by ~3 hours. The flight reached Singapore at 1130. Due to this the connecting flight to Perth which was set to depart at 1200 was missed. Due to this I along with my partner had to stay in Singapore city overnight at our own expenses at a hotel.

On arrival in Singapore, I inquired with Singapore Airlines Duty Manager on what our options were as our onward journey had been disrupted due to this delay of almost 3 hours to which I was offered no solution at all. In fact, my request was brushed aside by the duty manager based on the fact that I did not have a connecting flight booked with Singapore Airlines or Scoot and that this situation was ""no longer Singapore Airlines Problem"". I explained to the Duty Manager that a missed connection (either with Singapore Airlines group or any other carrier for that matter) put us in a position where we would incur costs associated with accommodation, meals, transport and loss of pay (in my case) to which the duty manager responded that those would have to be borne at my expense even though the delay was caused by a Singapore Airlines. As mentioned earlier, the general gist of the responses I received from the duty manager was that ""this is not our problem"".

Let me try and explain. I have been flying SIA back when they were still Malaysia Singapore Airways. I've always been impressed by the quality of the service until my last trip from Cape Town to Bali. In short, one of our bags never made it. I understand this can happen. It is not just the inconvenience of a lost bag it is also mourning the loss of memories for the items that were in the bag.

"Where can I start now… SQ has just dropped its standards when it comes to meals, drinks and onboard amenity kit. Only one meal on a 7.30 hour flight from SIN to SYD and no amenity kit on an overnight flight.
You get a dinner meal and that’s all you get. No breakfast, NO tea or coffee in the morning. The crew just take trays of water throughout the flight. Also the dinner is only 2 courses meal. Even Emirates is still serving 3 course in economy. Interesting that SYD to SIN sector you get two meals and more. Does SQ discriminate on who is flying onboard ? Qantas is providing 2 meals on SIN to SYD sectors.
It feels like SQ has cut down on many things and charging customer must higher fares for low quality product. 

SQ can't be considered as 5 star airline anymore. You might as well fly on Scoot for lower fare and pay for the meals.

"Vietnam to Singapore we were provided with a decent tasting meal and consistently good service.

Singapore to Manchester an entirely different experience. 

Awful food and not a great service. 

All I can say is don't chose the Carrot Cake Option. Nothing to do with what it sounds like! It smelt herendous & consisted of Prawns amongst other things.

Same with the Snacktime Bun we were given. It smelt vile & tasted of fermented fish in the middle. I felt like throwing up. 

The Scrambled Egg / Spinach option wasn't edible.  I called for a flight attendant to ask for an alternative. After explaining the food was inedible, I was asked what was wrong with it as everyone was eating it without complaint! 

The last thing I wanted  or expected was attitude from the air stewardess!",0.104,0.826,0.07,-0.7811,0.9581097364425659,0.03666161745786667,0.005228716880083084,4
"After flying a few times with Singapore Economy Class I decided to splurge and try Business Class, but I was disappointed for one main reason: I remember the slogan for Singapore Airlines used to be, 'Singapore Girl, you're a great way to fly!', and this is one of the rare cases of 'truth' in advertising and one of the main selling points and points of difference for Singapore airlines. But obviously, this slogan is not very PC or woke, and is no longer used because of those reasons; but that does not mean it isn't true or effective marketing. But worse than that, the Business class cabin was staffed by way too many male flight attendants; and even worse, the 'team leader' for all the flight attendants on all Singapore Airlines fights I have experienced (business and economy) was a man! So, Singapore Airlines have gone from 'Singapore Girl, you're a great way to fly!', to way too many male flight attendants and not even a Singapore girl or woman being the the boss of the inflight cabin crew! That is extremely stupid and disappointing! For Singapore Airlines to relinquish one of the best and most truthful slogans in airline marketing history because of woke or otherwise pressure is political correctness and 'equal opportunity' gone mad! Isn't it funny that for years women strive for equal opportunity to no avail, but when whining men cry for the same it is instantly realised to the detriment of everybody, including an airline's effective marketing slogan. The vocation of flight attendant is a 'care' vocation, like a tour guide, like child care, like elderly care, men should not do it. I will avoid Singapore Airlines in the future for this very reason: 'Singapore 'Man', you're NOT a great way to fly.",0.166,0.691,0.143,-0.6939,0.861485481262207,0.12282894551753998,0.015685591846704483,3
"The Airbus was an older model with no touch screen, no automatic seat adjustment and worst of all was the diagonal sleeping arrangement. Absolutely uncomfortable and squashed.

Our bag has not yet been returned even though I have an air tag inside it and I have provided Singapore Airlines with a photo of where the bag is located in Changi Airport.

"Wow. First flight with Singapore Airlines post pandemic and its nearly unrecognisable.

- new aircraft have much more cramped seating
- food is nearly inedible
- inflight entertainment system not working

The crew remain very attentive and tried their best to resolve the entertainment issues. But given such a poor product to begin with there efforts were redundant.

"Traveling back to New Zealand on this flight - had exit row seats in economy on an A380-800. probably seems good on booking but didn't enjoy the space seated in the seat. The seat just didn't seem wide enough? The ability I get straight out and stand up was great, but the nearness to the outlets was a let down. The food was. average to poor and wasn't what I remember pre-COVID. The flight was clean and crew kept the toilets very clean, but a full flight and seems the titles were always in use. In hindsight should have booked a window and aisle seat and hoped no booked the middle seat - lesson learned.

"Lying in bed listening to a thunderstorm in Langkawi my mind wandered back to how disappointed I was with my first Singapore Airlines flight. We travel to S E Asia a fair bit but usually SA is too expensive. I'll take a cheap flight and pay more for bulkhead seats, etc. This time I didn't bother because of all the gushing about SQ A350 plane.

Well more fool me. The seat was a shocker. Thin back and actual seat padding. I'm about 5 foot ten and I swear my knees were jammed up against the seat in front.

The food was rubbish and when food service was over, the woman in front reclined into me; I couldn't move, so I reclined and the woman behind me screamed at me. So thanks SA, my first mid air skirmish in 55 years of flying. 

The flight was only saved by top notch cabin crew service and the fact that we had a spare seat in our row. Never A350 again.",0.093,0.81,0.097,0.4125,0.7459408640861511,0.2047862559556961,0.049272820353507996,1
An amazing flight from Sydney to Singapore on Singapore Airlines A350 wide bodied airliner. From the ease of check in and boarding to a fantastic on board flight crew this flight could not have been better. The meal service was good as well as the drink selection.

"I love the Singapore airlines crew, about the best out there. Their business class seats, however, are the worst. There is no room directly in front of you and there is a small footwell at the side.

"This was a very disappointing experience considering the hype around the SQ soft and hard product in business.  Firstly let me say the Silverkris Lounge at Changi T3 was excellent. It was the highlight of my flight.  Normally the lounge is just the teaser with the inflight experience the main event.  Unfortunately the inflight experience was just disappointing.  At pre-departure I was offered a juice or champagne and I asked for water.  The FA literally told me to just drink from my water bottle.  No big deal but just not the right tone to set in a premium cabin.  Then there is the seat.  I flew the a380 with their new a380 business seats which i just didn’t like.  I found the seat uncomfortable and the seat padding pretty hard.  Their seat configuration was just really limited and the seat buttons very unresponsive when pressing them.  This was a night flight and this seat is just a terrible for sleeping.  The design when in flat bed mode forces you to lie on an angle  which was very awkward and uncomfortable.   The “seat cover” provided was very thin and no padding meaning you felt all the padding and upholstery of the seat which was just not very soft or giving.  The blanket provided was just too small and meant that either my arms or my feet were sticking out the entire time.  The seat looks good but for me was a total functional fail for comfort and awful for sleeping.  Sadly the food service was a real let down on this flight as well.  I “booked the cook” for my meal which certainly raised my expectations but what I got was average, bland  noodles that looked no different from the other inflight offerings.  My travel companion took the inflight breakfast offering and this was literally one of the worst meals not just in business but in any cabin class.  The scrambled eggs were quite literally inedible.  A goopy stream of “bits” of egg that must surely have been powdered or reconstituted egg,  It was just disgusting.  Totally unbelievable offering on a business class flight.  Whilst the flight was on time and the FAs polite and efficient I would not fly SQ business again unless it was a discounted ticket and I would be very hesitant even then to book a night flight on the a380 with this seat.",0.136,0.772,0.092,-0.9594,0.9047050476074219,0.08255304396152496,0.012741920538246632,3

"Flight on 22 April - Definitely downgraded since COVID. You used to get a flight pack, hot towel and an offer of a drink even before you left the ground, now ZILCH. There are much fewer flight attendants. They were practically running to try and get everyone their meals. You had no chance to ask for any other drinks as they were just too busy. There are no beauty items in the lavatories anymore. You used to be able to go and freshen up before landing but there was nothing. The lights were kept so dark I couldn’t work out how to open the lavatory door at first, which seems silly, but it really was quite black.
Flight on 23 April - We then changed to SQ432 for a flight to Male, Maldives. Two stewardesses and one food cart for the whole economy section. We left at 10:05 and got our meals at 13:30. By the time the stewardesses got to our row their hands were shaking as they had to try and get people to choose the fish option as they ran out of the chicken option by the row behind us. Once again there was no chance to ask for a drink as the stewardesses were just too busy. One lot of parents let their child run down the walkway several times which we didn’t think should have been allowed for several reasons, one of them of course is safety. 
The space for each seat has definitely grown smaller. You don’t have enough room to reach down in front of you really, unless you’re lucky enough to be on the aisle.

"We've used Sinapore Airlines, (economy class), in the past and been happy with the service and food. This year we booked to fly to Melbourne, from Manchester, expecting the same good service.The first indication that things had changed occured not long after booking. We received an email stating that our flight times to Frankfurt had changed. In reality this meant we couldn't make the next stage flights to Melbourne. No alternative was provided and SA were not in the least bit bothered that we could no longer actually get to Melbourne. After an hour or more on the phone to SA my husband managed to get new flights. Sadly, this  poor service contined on the flights. The food was awful - poor quality. I wondered if it was just the gluten free meals, (bread roll still frozen to name just one problem),but my husband who had the standard food, also found some of it to be inedible. I was also offered snacks containing wheat/gluten even after I'd checked with the cabin crew that they were gf. Barely an apology and no alternative offered. In additon to this, not enough water offered on a flight of almost 14 hours - people had to keep going to the galley asking for drinks.

"Singapore Airlines A350-900 medium-haul aircraft is fitted with two cabins with 40 Business Class seats and 263 Economy Class seats. The 40 seats in Business Class are split into two sections, with 28 seats in the forward cabin, the larger cabin and 12 seats in the smaller rear cabin. The 1-2-1 seat configuration in Singapore Airlines’ regional Business Class product gives all passengers direct aisle access.

There are three lavatories, one located up front right behind the cockpit and another two between the two Business Class sections, serving all 40 passengers in Business Class. Singapore Airlines differentiates its Business Class lavatories from Economy Class by fitting them with brown leather backsplashes on the bulkhead. Singapore Airlines is one of the few airlines that packs its lavatories with amenities for guests’ convenience.

Singapore Airlines regional Business Class seats have a seat pitch of 60″ and measure 28″ wide, providing its passengers with excellent legroom and enhanced privacy despite not having a door, thanks to the cacoon seat design. Singapore Airlines regional Business Class seats feature a 180° lie-flat bed. The seats come with several handy modes programmed into the seat control buttons on the side of the seat. Besides the seat controls, Singapore Airlines also included light controls and attendant call buttons on the touch-panelled seat control buttons.

pops out in its storage mode, which is half the size of the table. Passengers who do not need the large table can use it in its storage mode. The seat table folds out to its dining mode, which is twice the size of its storage mode. The seat table does not feel wobbly and is perfect for dining and working on a 16″ laptop. Under the IFE screen is a footwell, which is meant for passengers to stretch their feet into when the seat is deployed in its bed mode. Singapore Airlines fully used the space under the footwell by leaving it empty to double up as a space to stow carry-on or for passengers to place their shoes.

There is no lack of storage space on Singapore Airlines’ regional Business Class seats. There is a small cabinet at the side of each side for passengers to stow smaller items like mobile phones and passports. The small sliding door installed at the cabinet ensures the items inside remain secure and out of sight. Within the cabinet, passengers can find an international power socket and two USB charging outlets, making it very convenient for passengers to get juice for their devices. A hook next to the cabinet creates space for passengers to hang the headphones provided by Singapore Airlines when not in use. Singapore Airlines designed the space by the cabinet as a side table, which doubles up as a cocktail table, for passengers to place small items on. I thought the biggest flaw with the Singapore Airlines regional Business Class seats was the placement of the seat pocket. The seat pocket is placed at the lower corner of the seat on the back of the seat in front. Passengers wanting to access the seat pocket must unbuckle their seat belts and stretch for it. The seat pocket seems to be meant only for Singapore Airlines to place in-flight magazines and safety cards as it is too shallow (and tight) to fit in anything else.

Singapore Airlines fits its Business Class with a large 18″ LED touchscreen TV. The LED TV can be tilted downwards so passengers can still watch the numerous options on KrisWorld lying down on the flatbed mode of the seat. The entertainment options on KrisWorld are laid out in an intuitive menu for passengers to browse and select from hundreds of shows, from the latest blockbuster movies to TV shows and even games. KrisWorld can be accessed via the touchscreen function on the TV or via the mobile phone, like IFE controller found under the seat controls at the side of the seat. Singapore Airlines supplies noise-cancelling headphones to its Business Class passengers. These headphones effectively cancel out the ambient noise from the aircraft cabin and are comfortable to put on. Business Class passengers are given free wifi to use onboard. 

Singapore Airlines does not offer its signature “Book the Cook” service for flights originating from Bangkok. I opted for the Indonesian Fried Rice, while my friend chose the Pan Fried Salmon. Of the three courses of the meal served, I thought only the appetiser was tasty. The Indonesian Fried Rice I had was disappointing in taste and presentation. I thought the presentation of the meal did not enhance its appetising appeal, the fried rice looked haphazardly splattered on the china, and the vegetables looked like a mess. The grilled chicken tasted blend, the fried rice tasted like plain steamed rice, and the vegetable was overpowered with spiciness. The sticky pudding dessert looked like some mouldy bread, but I tasted the dessert nonetheless. The pudding was too sweet for my liking that I had to wash the taste with Coke. My friend also commented the Pan Fried Salmon he opted for tasted bland and dry.

Service on Singapore Airlines Business Class was exceptional. The excellent service started the moment I boarded the aircraft. Cabin crew offered me pre-departure drinks, introducing Singapore Airlines’ latest cocktail, Bellini. When told I do not drink too much, the cabin crew offered me another glass of orange juice in case I was not too fond of the cocktail. Before taking off, the cabin crew – Stephanie stopped by every seat under her charge to introduce herself to all the passengers she would be taking care of during the flight. Despite a full flight, I find cabin crews onboard made an effort to check in with passengers if we required anything else.

Towards the end of the flight, a passenger sitting across from me started to make noise about the requirement to submit an online arrival card in Singapore. He kicked up a ruckus that the ground staff did not inform him of this requirement. Instead of brushing him aside, I witness Stephanie patiently helping the passenger fill out an online form while her colleagues stand in for her to conduct pre-landing checks. I overheard Stephaine volunteering to share her mobile data with him when we landed to ensure the passenger could enter Singapore smoothly. Despite it being the passenger’s fault for not checking the immigration requirements, Stephaine handled the situation with much patience and professionalism.",0.022,0.92,0.058,0.9889,0.019308337941765785,0.4252389073371887,0.5554527044296265,5
"We flew on Singapore Airlines B787-10 for this flight. The Economy Class cabin is further segregated into two sections, with 150 seats in the forward cabin and 151 in the aft cabin. Singapore Airlines uses three colours: brown, grey, and turquoise, for its Economy Class seats. In addition, the use of mood lighting for different moments of the flight, such as white lighting during boarding and disembarking and purple/orange lighting during the morning flight time, allows passengers to relax during the flight.

There are several lavatories dotted across the two sections of the Economy Class. The lavatory onboard is not exactly the largest, but it is very functional. The mirrors in the lavatory make the space appears larger than it is. The hardworking cabin crews on Singapore Airlines constantly kept the lavatory very clean for the duration of the fight. I like the touch-free features, such as the sensor-activated tap and the toilet flush to the step-activated trash bin cover, which provided convenience to passengers and were extremely important in this endemic period. Singapore Airlines is one of the few airlines worldwide that still provides toothbrushes in their lavatories other than the standard hand soap.

Economy Class seats on Singapore Airlines B787-10 are arranged in a 3-3-3 configuration. Each seat has a 32″ seat pitch and measures 17″ wide with a 5″ recline. Despite the very thin-looking Economy Class seats on Singapore Airlines, which do not seem to provide much cushioning, these seats are very comfortable for the short two-hour flight. In addition, the four-way adjustable headrest contributes to the comfort afforded by these Economy Class seats. The controls for reading light control and call attendant buttons are found under the IFE screen. There is also a sizable tray table on every seat. A standalone cup holder is fitted under the IFE screen, allowing passengers to stow their cups of drinks without needing to deploy the tray table. The seat pockets on Singapore Airlines are designed to allow passengers to maximise the usage of these pockets and also make it easier for passengers to locate the items they placed inside the pockets. 

An 11.1″ touchscreen TV is fitted in every Economy Class seat. There are many entertainment options on Singapore Airlines’ KrisWorld, ranging from the latest Hollywood blockbusters to TV shows. The intuitive menu options on KrisWorld are very well organised, making scrolling through them a breeze. Singapore Airlines provides earplugs for every passenger, though some might not find stuffing things in their ears comfortable. Singapore Airlines also provides complementary wifi for its KrisFlyer members (regardless of status) and passengers flying in Business Class or higher cabins. The wifi onboard is very stable but can only handle chats, email browsing and uploading to social media.

We were given two options for breakfast today – Singapore Fried Carrot Cake with Prawns and Scrambled Eggs with Chicken Sausage. I chose the Fried Carrot Cake for breakfast. I am not a fan of the take-out box design used in regional Economy Class, as it made the portion feel small and was challenging to eat from. Singapore Airlines only served its Economy Class passengers a yoghurt. The meal was delicious and full of flavours. My friend opted for the Scrambled Eggs and found the eggs to be a tad dry and the sausage bland.

Service onboard Singapore Airlines was impeccable, as always. We were greeted by the warm and friendly cabin crews. The cabin crew worked tirelessly to serve all the passengers and attended to their requests despite being a full flight.

"I booked my return flight to Europe for July 2023  in October 2022. I am a Krisflyer member. At the start of this year I received a text message from SQ saying I had been „off-loaded“ for my return flught. No further explanation was given. When I finally reached a customer service person on the phone after an hour wait, I was told the plane had been overbooked and no seats were now available. I was not on the flight any more.  I was offered to either rebook for the next day or get a refund for the flight - the latter was not an option as I need to get back home.  I agreed to be rebooked for a departure the following day. This means an additional cost as I have to stay at the airport hotel and I had to take 1 day unpaid leave from work. When I contacted the customer chat service, they said I had „volunteered“ by agreeing to the change and was therefore not entitled to any compensation.  No other airline I have flown with has ever tried to get away with such a low level of customer care and responsibility They offered me 2000  Krisflyer points, which is laughable- what can  you get for that?",0.059,0.89,0.051,-0.1063,0.7237849235534668,0.24646082520484924,0.029754266142845154,2

"Booked a family trip from Uk to Australia via Singapore, Premium Economy, almost a year in advance. Chose the flights due to time of flights, length of stopover and price.
Prior to flying, the airline changed the flights on 7 different occasions. Changes were substantial meaning we had to completely change our holiday plans which incurred a lot of costs, cancelling and rebooking hotels (obviously the airline said it wasn’t their problem) We lost the capacity to sit together, as flights were changed once everyone else had booked seats. We were also booked onto ridiculous alternative flights with stupid transfer times which were always going to be unattainable. On each occasion I spoke to the airline, they were unapologetic and had a general attitude that I should be grateful they were helping me at all.
Unsurprisingly the flights didn’t work and we missed connections. The airline was again unapologetic ( they say the word sorry but do nothing). We were bumped onto economy flights and told they didn’t give compensation. On the economy flights we were seated next to the toilets and there wasn’t enough food to give us a meal. Again we were told they don’t give compensation.

"We travelled first class on the A380 from Singapore to London and had the absolute pleasure of what an amazing on board service. If you can ever do this, even once, do. We used points for this so whilst I do travel with work, we had saved hard to round off our honeymoon in style.

Now to the fun stuff. We had just arrived on a business class flight from Osaka, it was red eye and we arrived at 5am into Singapore. After a little wonder round we headed to the highly anticipated lounge. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a friendly member of staff who saw our first class ticket and escorted us in. My wife went to the toilet and I ordered a tea, at this point my ticket was checked again. Fine. 
The lounge has sleeping areas and we asked if we could use one of these given the 5 hours until our next flight. We were told no problem and as we walked over the lounge Manager came over and asked us for our boarding pass and passport again. At this point it's getting a bit weird and to be quite honest I'm feeling a little judged. I have flown first and business with many airlines for work and its a bit odd when you have to show your boarding pass 3 times. FIRST ISSUE.

About an 30 minutes later, I am dosing and my wife is in the pod across from me and a man comes pushing through my door either blogging or talking to a friend on video. I jump out of bed and tell him in quite direct terms to get out. Half asleep I then notice he walks across and goes straight into my wife's room. It turns out she had been reading and was just getting ready to sleep. This man has walked straight past the lounge manager (who it turns out wasn't at her desk) and into my wife's room. If I hadn't of noticed the mind wonders as to what could have happened. 

We are sickened by this experience as we were told that the rooms were monitored and the doors didn't lock unless specifically done. (Let's just say they were then locked). The way this incident was brushed off in the lounge was atrocious, no one wanted to take accountability and approach the man so for all I know he still has this footage. 

I submitted a feedback form 15 days ago and have followed up on the phone 3 times. At this point they have told me I need to wait for someone to get back to me. It ruined our experience that we had waited for, for 6 months as it was the last part of our honeymoon. 

This is probably the longest review I have ever written and I know it doesn't apply to most but there are a few things to note.

"These people are liars, false advertisers, and couldn’t care less about their customers. 
My wife and I flew with Singapore Airlines for our Honeymoon. 1 week in Thailand and 1 week in Bali. We paid for business class for our flight to Thailand. The day before our flight, the airline informed us that our connecting flight (Singapore to Bangkok) had been cancelled. I called customer service immediately and they told me that they do not offer business class flights from Singapore to Bangkok and that I would need to use a different airline. I told them that this is absolutely unacceptable and after speaking with 3 different supervisors, the flight that they told me was cancelled/doesn’t exist, all of a sudden It’s not cancelled and It does exist and my wife and I were able to take that exact flight.
Fast forward to the end of our Honeymoon…we receive an email from Singapore Airlines asking us if we’d like to upgrade our flights home to Business Class as well. We carefully reviewed the email to ensure that both my wife and I would have both the flight from Bali to Singapore and the flight from Singapore back to the USA would be upgraded. Only after we PAID for the upgrade did Singapore Airlines inform us that they are only upgrading the 2 hour flight from Bali to Singapore, not the 19 hour flight from Singapore to Newark. We immediately contacted customer service yet again but we were told that there was no supervisor available and that we would receive a call back first thing in the morning. After NOT receiving a call back, my wife called YET AGAIN and after speaking with 4 different people over the course of 3 hours, we finally got a supervisor on the phone who informed us that he had corrected the error and that we would receive our business class boarding passes at the airport when we check into our flights. This was an outright lie!!!! We arrived at the airport and found out that we would not be flying business class for our 19 hour flight. After deciding that we don’t have the energy to fight this anymore, we checked into our flight and made our way to the premier lounge. Once arriving at the lounge my name was called on the intercom twice within 10 minutes to report to the customer service counter.

"Singapore airlines single handily made our honeymoon an absolute nightmare. 
We were heading to Thailand and Bali for our 2 week honeymoon. THE DAY OF our flight out to Thailand, they cancelled our connecting flight from Singapore to Bangkok (after we had upgraded our flights from premium economy to Business) and we spent THREE HOURS on the phone until they were able to finally fix it and find us a connecting flight (which they told us didn’t exist, but magically it appeared after fighting with the customer service rep). 

Then, on our returning flight, we had received an email about upgrading our flight again to business class and the email clearly specified that we would be upgrading both legs of our flight. After paying to upgrade, only one leg of our flight was upgraded. Mind you, it was the 2 hour flight and not the 18hr flight back to NY. Upon realizing only one leg was upgraded, we immediately called customer service to have the issue fixed. Because it was late at night, the woman on the phone promised me she would have a supervisor contact me the next day. After not receiving a call back, I called back and spent another 2 hours on the phone and after talking to FOUR people was told that they would be able to fix the issue at the ticket counter once we checked in for our boarding pass. 

Not only was that not true, but then I had to speak with multiple people at the counter as well as call customer service back AGAIN only to be told they could do nothing and the “matter would be escalated”. 

Not only do they false advertise, but they outright lie to customers just to get them off the phone and their customer service could care less about their actual clients.

"Check in and lounge

We were flying from LHR to SIN, in business, check in was such a breeze, queueless, no waiting time. The lounge was outstanding, extremely comfy seats and great service in the lounge as well as power outlets and charging spots.

Boarding and ontime service

Boarding was also pretty much queueless, the cabin crew greeted us warmly and showed us to our seats and when the safety video commenced, we were just leaving the gate, but the only thing that disappointed me was that our flight took off 40 mins late than scheduled but landed before the estimated time of arrival.
Probably because air traffic control was pretty busy at that time.

The flight

Crew were extremely kind, serving us food and drink every now and then we were hangry and wanting to eat or thirsty for drinks. They also have an unbelievably large in-flight entertainment selection, they were endless! Seat was also amazing, super comfy and very easy to sleep on if you are having and overnight flight out of SIN or LHR. Toilets are also very clean and regularly get disinfected, in which I believed greatly in, as I had also flown this airline back in October.

Arrival

Upon arrival, we were all well rested and didn't want to leave the plane, the cabin crew said goodbye to us kindly and generously, and got our bags, straight as we came through passport control.

"This was probably one of worst experiences of a commercial airline. I heard and read such good reviews I was looking forward to flying with them. A 13 1/2 hour flight, a daytime flight, no sooner we had taken off, they wanted the window shutters down and dimmed the lights- remember that this was a daytime flight. They wanted everyone to sleep so they wouldn’t have to give any service. We asked for a bottle of water, none available just given half a plastic glass of water out of the tank. Food was awful and no snacks offered. We had to keep asking for water or juice to try to keep dehydrated. Only went to use the bathroom once……. Floor soaking wet, toilet not flushing fully and sink blocked (half full of water). Getting off the flight we both had bagging headaches and had to buy water to rehydrate.

"The Singapore girl is as much as a wonder as a delight. Before I am excused of sexism, there were male FA,s in service as well. you can say that they are representative of the country as a whole - warm, hospitable, excellence in efficiency and execution and yes culturally some what sterile. Our journey began in the utter chaos and dysfunction of Bangalore, India's 5th metro city, and South Asia's Si Valley and supposedly the Indian metro with the highest median income. Since the SQ flight from KIA left at 11 pm or so, we were airport bound, a distance of ~ 40 km during evening peak hour. To avoid inner city traffic jams our driver took us through the ""back alleys"" to get as close as he could to the highway north of BNC area. Oh well! Check in was super smooth. A SQ baggage handler at check in moved our 4 bags from the trolleys to the conveyor belt and refused a thank you money. The international dep lounge used by most airline at KIA is a nice space but can do better. Hopefully the new T2 where all phoren flights will A/D may have a nicer version. The lounge food was OK, the gin tonic seemed too dilute etc and not sure if the lounge has a shower facility. Great staff and clean otherwise. Boarding for us was thru a common mid cabin gate as our seats were closer to the end of the section and occurred along with the Y passengers. The A350-900 J module was of the older variety and was not as plush as on the SIN-LAX sector. since the cabin crew had come in from SIN and were also doing the return leg, a bit of fatigue showed on their faces, entirely understandable. we departed on time with a flying time of approx 3.5 hrs. Food (somewhat aflatoon) by Sanjeev Kapoor was ok but could have been better? The best was the simple rice with thin sliced shallots and chilgoze. The Chianti was superb as per my sources. Arrival at Changi was a breeze. Now this is where the effortless efficiency of this city-state shows. Since we had an e passport and had completed the required form online, exit from immigration was contactless and took <1 minute thru 2 barrriers. We were at luggage claim well before our bags that showed up 10 mins later. getting a taxi was efffortless and the ride to the other end of the island was smooth. In the early morning brain fog, the chaos of India/Bengaluru, and Twighlight hours, all i could utter ""yeh kahaan aggaye hum yun hi saath chalte chalte"" (yeah my Rekha darling was with me). we arrived at our location with NO issues, drivers use the GPS from point A to B, and there is NO tipping culture for services anywhere in the Lion City. After our 4 day stay we returned to Changi T3 to board the LAX flight. You need to tell the taxi driver your class of service as entry gates are different for J/Y etc. Check in was smooth. contactless scan your PP, and you can headd to duty free or lounge/gate etc. The dedicated SQ lounge in our terminal is supposedly not as nice as others (must be older) but worked for us - all we needed was a safe secluded space to wait until boarding. Lounge food is nothing to write home about, the men's room had NO smell of piss, pee or phenyl, no buzzing insects,and were super clean (NO pubic hair littering the urinals). Our gate was a good 10 minute walk from the lounge. Security was at the gate it self, boarding was hassle free and the J cabin was superb on our A350-900. Clear differences in the business module were evident on the two sectors we flew.  The cabin staff, service  was warm and unobtrusive. if you are seated the cabin crew at times bent down to your eye level, who does that? In my 44 years of flying across continents the most recent such warmth was shown only by SWISS on the Zurich-DEL sector in an otherwise lack luster J hard product. The SQ J hard product had many storage bins, a reading light, a few indirect lights (in case you dont wish to use the overhead one) and the food served was the best i have had in any J cabin (my J experience is only 5 years, before that it was always Y). I am glad i had preordered a vegetarian meal - the onboard menu had no vegetarian option (quite unlike EU airlines that seem to include at least a pasta option). The IFE is OK, nothing like EK.  dont have too a high a hope on the amenity kit, tooth paste/brushes and razor/gel pouch were available in the toilets. Again rekha darling lovd herr on board red vino selection. Arrival at LAX was a no brainer, had to wait a bit longer than expected for bags, exit of Immigration with a US PP and global entry was a breeze. given my tepid experience on the BLR-SIN leg the prestigious NA sector ULHs were in a different league. Towards the end of the 14 hr 15 min nonstop, I did thank the cabin crew and the service manager for the warm and excellent SQ service. I also realised that in J, the crew is super busy preparing and serving a 3 course meal. Overall these ULH flights are a challenge for the flight crew. My salaams to them. Give it a try and check it out for yourself someday (SQ ULHs).

I will NEVER book on Singapore again and just want to give a heads up to their ridiculous policy.    Basically their policy is they can give you a flight with a year long layover and then charge you to change it!

"On Sunday 5 Feb at 630pm my partner Dominic and I went to check into our flights home at the Singapore Airlines check in at Heathrow Airport. We had booked through Singapore Airlines from Canberra, Australia to London return, all flights booked through Singapore Airlines as per booking reference 560NMJ. Our flights were London to Singapore and Singapore to Brisbane via Singapore Airlines, then Brisbane to Canberra, Virgin Airlines but booked by Singapore Airlines. When checking in the lady at the Singapore Airlines check in advised nothing showed up regarding our flight from Brisbane to Canberra. She told us to go to the Singapore Airlines ticket counter so we left check in and went there. 

Once arriving at the Singapore Airlines ticket counter I explained we had booked all our flights through Singapore Airlines, and that our original flight from Brisbane to Canberra (1245pm on 7 Feb) had been cancelled and we were sent an email regarding this and had accepted the changed flight departing 5pm from Brisbane, which would then mean 6 hours at Brisbane airport instead of 2 hours. First the women at the Singapore Airlines ticket counter advised they couldn't see our connecting flight from Brisbane. Then told us we had never been booked on the 5pm Virgin flight and that it was Virigin's fault because it was their flight. I had to explain to the women that it had all been booked by Singapore Airlines. Then they told us many conflicting things at once, including that the 5pm had been cancelled, then that it wasn't cancelled but the flight was full and we would have to get on the next flight at 8pm, then they said we were still on the 5pm flight, then again that we weren't on any and we would have to get the 8pm flight from Brisbane. Then they told me that what happened was we were on a 1245pm flight but that got cancelled and we were put on the 5pm one, I said to them I told you that in the first minute of talking to you. Then they brought another representative over (I think his name was Sebastian), he told us that the 5pm flight was full and they couldn't ask people to get off the flight just to put us on it and all they could do was put us on the 8pm flight. By this stage I was in tears as we already had a 13 hour flight to Singapore, 6 hours layover in Singapore, 8 hours to Brisbane, 6 hours to Brisbane then 2 hours to Canberra, and now we were being told we were going to be waiting 9 hours at Brisbane. While I was crying one of the women starting laughing/rolling her eyes/scoffing and saying how I just didn't understand, despite the fact it was me trying to explain to her Singapore Airlines had booked all our flights so it was their responsibility. They told us when we got to Singapore we could go find the Virgin counter and try ourselves to get on the 5pm flight as there was nothing they could do. Sebastian said the request for us to be put on the 5pm flight had gone through after we accepted the change but it was never confirmed. I asked why it was never confirmed and finally they had to admit it was ""a technical or human error"" by Singapore Airlines. Only then did they try again to get us on the 5pm flight while still saying we would have to get the 8pm flight. I asked how we would be compensated for Singapore Airlines not confirming the 5pm flight and therefore us having to wait 9 hours at a domestic airport, Sebastian said there was nothing I could do but ""write an email"". After much pushing back, they managed to get us on the 5pm flight and when we finally got to Brisbane and boarded it, the flight (VA1224/SQ6440) was no where near full, there was maybe 1/4 of the plane empty, despite the Singapore Airlines representatives insisting to us it was fully booked and we would have to get on the 8pm one. This was all extra upsetting as when we booked the flights we were only ever meant to stay at Brisbane for 2 hours and be on a 1245pm flight back to Canberra after already having to wait 6 hours at Singapore, I understand it's not Singapore Airlines fault the 1245pm flight got cancelled but we would never have booked that specific trip if we knew an additional 6 hours at Brisbane (let alone 9 hours) was going to occur. It was mentally and physically draining to have two 6+ hour layovers on the way home as the two long flights are already a lot to deal with, but before we even started the journey I had already been mentally drained and brought to tears by Singapore Airlines staff.

We should not have had to experience any of this, our connecting flight to Canberra should have been in the system as soon as we initially went to check in. Not only was it not in the system but we had to face the 3 Singapore Airline reps at Heathrow Airport, convince them it was Singapore Airlines responsibility as we had booked through them and then plead with them to get us on the connecting flight despite it being their responsibility, all while being laughed at and scoffed at while in tears. The push back we got from staff was shocking, how they made out like I was confused and didn't understand, how they tried to blame it all on Virgin and how they wanted us as the customers to sort it out ourselves with Virgin before I finally helped them to understand it was Singapore Airline's responsibility. It took about an hour standing at the ticket counter to get this sorted when it should never have been an issue in the first place. 

I have always spoken so highly of Singapore Airlines but never in my entire time travelling have I experienced such horrible treatment, and such a lack of empathy from airline staff. 

I wrote to them to submit a complaint about and received no reply, it’s been almost two months and multiple follow up emails and still no response or acknowledgment.

"I had an extremely disappointing experience with Singapore Airlines.
My holiday plans changed and i needed to make some changes to the dates and times of the flights, but this appeared to be impossible to complete.
On 2 or 3 separate occasions i called the Singapore Airlines telephone helpline and talked to operators in the Philippines. On each of these occasions i spent 2 to 3 hours trying to undertake and confirm some simple changes to my flights. On each occasion the operators were not able to process and confirm the requested changes.

I also (on numerous occasions) emailed Singapore Airlines with the details of the required changes and the details of the telephones conversations.

From all of my attempts to communicate with Singapore Airlines i did not receive a single communication or confirmation in response. Incredibly there was no audit trail or evidence of any of my conversations with them.

I checked my itinerary through the Singapore Airlines website about 3 weeks before i was due to leave to find that my return flight to NZ had been completely cancelled. I then decided to cancel the flights, but was incredulous when i found that i would have to pay the flight cancellation fee - this despite the debacle that had occurred up to this point. 

In the end i had to purchase a last minute, expensive flight with an alternative airline - which was a very simple and straightforward process.

In summary, i spent and wasted significant amounts of time dealing with Singapore Airlines, had to pay a cancellation fee and incurred significant additional cost as a result of Singapore Airlines ineptitude. I have flown with Singapore Airlines previously and have found their aircraft and services to be good, but i am disgusted with how i have been treated on this occasion.

The suite was nice but the leather felt dirty. The staff were far too over the top and this did not feel genuine but rather subservient. Feel that other airlines do much better at genuine customer service. SQ needs to review their uniforms as the women’s tops and skirts all looked way too tight and that style is now rather dated. The men’s suits all looked modern in comparison. The Lalique toiletries were lovely. The menu selection was vast and the best part of the entire flight. 
One of my bags was badly damaged. It was brand new and I inadvertently had two photos to prove tgat at the airport the bag was not damaged. I had NOTHING BUT ISSUES with SQ. They insisted I claim this on my travel insurance despite proof that the damage was caused buy them/an agent acting for them. I had staff members be incredibly rude and even lie to me. I have never had such horrific treatment. 
I’d never spend this amount of money with SQ again. In fact, I’ll never fly with them again. SQ staff are substandard.",0.113,0.767,0.12,0.3787,0.8043792247772217,0.15837131440639496,0.03724938631057739,1
"Return flight to London, again in Premium Economy. This time is was almost all flown in daylight as opposed to overnight going out. Changi is an amazing airport and we sailed through all aspects to get to the gate. However the man directing boarding with his microphone was completely illegible (it did make most of the passengers laugh though) and so boarding turned into a bit of a bun fight.

It was a 24 seat Premium Economy cabin as going out so had the same pros and cons. It was full, as Business appeared to be too but Economy was only about three quarters full.

The cabin crew were only marginally more visible during this flight as they did a drinks service just after take off unlike the overnight flight going out. It all felt portion controlled, even BA are more generous with their pours and selection. However, if a drink you wanted was not on the trolley they made a note and returned a short while later with it. 

We did 'book the cook' again which expanded our meal choice considerably with more Western dishes. The first meal was quite good actually. There was no dessert on the meal tray but the crew came round with ice cream when the meal service was almost over. 

After the first meal service, the masked cabin crew disappeared again and were barely seen until the second meal service. However, like the outgoing flight, came quickly if summoned and were polite and efficient. The female cabin crew appeared more friendly than the male cabin crew, who were rather officious and abrupt (and there were quite a few of them).

The entertainment was the same as going out, so a very good selection. However, there appeared to be glitches in the system on this flight as we noticed quite a few reboots going on around us. My screen did freeze quite often which caused losses in sound which spoiled the viewing somewhat. The extensive music channels were fine.

The second meal was served rather sooner than expected, there were still about five hours to go when the cabin crew magically reappeared. It was a 'book the cook' option again but not as nice as our first meal. 

As with the outward flight, the toilets deteriorated as the flight progressed (and this time non too fragrant!). Paper towels ran out again as did facial tissues.

Again we took off on time and landed early which was good.",0.031,0.869,0.101,0.986,0.07024288177490234,0.34218740463256836,0.5875697135925293,3
"Disappointed with this flight. Thought Singapore Airlines was the gold standard. It was just ordinary. We took off on time which was great as it was a late night flight and arrived ahead of schedule. 

Premium economy was a small cabin (24 seats) but there was not much to suggest this class and the massive upcharge over economy. The seat recline was quite clever (A350) in that on full recline it slide so as not to encroach too much on the passenger space behind.  The noise cancelling headphones were effective and the entertainment screen was larger than in economy with a very good selection of films, music, TV etc. but there was not other amenity except a bottle of water. 

You could 'book a cook' which expanded the food selection considerably (mainly Asian cuisine though) but nearing midnight, who can face a meal? There were two full service meals. We only had the second one and it was acceptable.

The cabin crew did the bare minimum and hid away for much of flight. However, when called, they responded quickly and politely. The wearing of masks did not help their cause, it was difficult to understand them and it felt like a medical flight!

The lavatories deteriorated over the length of the flight and things like paper towels etc were poorly managed.

I always thought BA were poor but they aren't that bad having now flown Singapore Airlines.",0.061,0.814,0.124,0.9613,0.3280333876609802,0.4309821128845215,0.2409844547510147,3

"This was our last leg of our flights home to Brisbane. 
We had a 12hr layover in Singapore Changai due to the connecting flight out JFK NY being 3hrs late and Singapore airlines rebooking us due to this. 
They emailed us the morning before the flight to let us know. Noy good having a 12hr layover but they did there best to get us a connecting flight which is good.
The flight left a few minutes late as they didn't open the lounge / gate until 40mins before the flight and everyone had to be screened to get through to the gate. We got off about ten minutes late but this was made up in the flight so we landed on time.
We were allocated seats 58A&B and were one of the last groups to board. It was a full flight but we still had some space for our bags above us in the overhead luggage bins. We had someone next to us so we couldn't spread out.
The crew were excellent and served the meal after taking off. After the meal, the lights were dimmed and I then accessed the excellent inflight entertainment system and watched some movies on it.
The staff were on the ball and were constantly bring water and juice around for the whole flight.
The only downside to the flight were some inconsiderate people sitting in front of us and putting seats back when you were trying to eat. The crew were excellent and pulled them up on this. Some people just need to be more aware of what they are doing and respect other passengers. 
Overall, the flight was good with little turbulence only.
I love flying Singapore airlines as the planes are clean and well serviced, the crew is fantastic, always polite and courteous and ensure the comfort of there guests.
this was highlighted by the flight stewardesses cuddling a baby when the mum was trying to get ready to get off the plane. The genuine care you could see from the staff was excellent. I cant recommend Singapore Airlines enough.",0.022,0.783,0.195,0.9974,0.0201872531324625,0.09819845855236053,0.8816143274307251,5
"I was excited about going on an A380-800 for the first time as Id never flown in one before, however that was tainted by already receiving an email at 6am that morning to say that they had rebooked our onward connection from Singapore Changai to Brisbane international into a 12 hour layover as the flight out of JFK NY left 3hrs late and we wouldn't be able to connect to our original flight.
We checked in ok and got a 15 euro meal voucher each to spend at the airport for food due to the delay.
The plane came in to Frankfurt on the new scheduled time and was turned around quickly by the ground crew and we were soon boarding for our flight to Singapore. We had booked seats as I wanted to be able to see the engines and the seat was excellent for this. We booked seats 43A&B which were forward economy seats so we were the last group to board.
The seat was a standard economy seat with the only issue being a small metal box cutting into the footwell for seat 43A. Not much but just enough to be a pain.
I really enjoyed take off and landing with the view of the engines.
The service again from the Air Singapore crew was excellent. Very attentive and professional. The inflight entertainment system, KrisWorld, is excellent and has something for everyone. It was a 12hr flight which is long when flying in economy.
The A380-800 was very clean inside.
One thing I did note on the bottom level window seat was the bulkhead is about 9 inches away from the seat so it makes resting the pillow against the window impossible to sleep on. When on the A350's, the gap is better for this.
Still, an excellent flight and great service from the Singapore team. Although we had a delay, they had rebooked everything and informed us every step of the way and helped everyone make connections when the plane landed in Singapore. Still not a fan of 12 hour layovers though, but they did their best for us.

"12hrs on a long haul flight is always a hard task in economy. Even though the company  is great and the service always excellent, a standard economy seat is not the most comfortable place for 12hrs sitting down. 
The plane was an A350-900 and it was very clean inside as usual. 
However, the flight boarded on time and left on time which is good. It was late when we left and followed the night all the flight. The staff served the 1st meal and then the lights were dimmed. The food was plane but nourishing, still a nice little meal. The staff kept up a supply of water and juice all flight and attended everyone's needs well. The staff are always excellent and I cant say anything negative about the experience. There was turbulence for about 4hrs after the dinner service and then it was smooth after that. I like the supply of toothpaste and toothbrushes in the toilets, it is very freshening to be able to brush your teeth on a flight. We arrived into Munich on a foggy morning and I actually felt refreshed after having a sleep on the flight.

This is the 3rd time we've flown with Singapore airline and we still enjoy their service. The flight out of Brisbane was on time. We didn't have reserved seats and were given 67J&K and we didn't have anyone else in our 3 seat row so we spread out which was nice. The service by the crew is always professional. They served the meal then the lights were dimmed. They constantly bring water and refreshments around so we kept our fluids up and didn't get dehydrated. The Kris inflight entertainment system is great with heaps to chose from. They have some of the latest movies out so it was nice to watch them. It was only a 7hr flight so nice and short for the 1st hop. The plane landed on time in Singapore to a warm barmy night.

"Here are my details of my trip. 
2nd March, 2023 – I flew with Delta to JFK in order to connect with Singapore airlines – JFK-FRA-SIN-HKT , due to arrive 4th March, 2023. When I arrived at JFK, on my way to collect my luggage I saw a Singapore desk in the area. So, I decided to stop and ask for directions: where to get my bag and where to check in with Singapore airlines. It was staffed by 2 individuals. While asking for directions and informing them that I will pick up by luggage from Delta and bring it across to the check-in desk. They both told me that it wasn’t necessary, just show them my Delta tag and my itinerary and they will have my luggage picked up and delivered to Singapore. I asked them twice if they are sure because Delta is not Star alliance. However, my luggage wasn’t picked up from the Delta carousel. 
3rd March, 2023 – Attempt to ask and verify my luggage was on board to a Singapore rep in Frankfurt, where I was told that she was too busy to help me I should come back later. 
4th March, 2023 – I arrived in Singapore and I went to T2 service desk (near F30) and was told that my luggage is in the system, it would arrive in Phuket. 
I arrived in Phuket but my luggage was missing, I was first told by the ground staff in Phuket that it was in Singapore and would arrive the next day and that I should make a claim. I did just that.

5th March, 2023 – I waited 2 days before I realized that I was receiving no assistance from Singapore airlines except for e-mails stating that they are sorry for the delayed baggage. That’s when I had to take action on my own. I received this message about 10 times over the past few days. ""We are still trying to locate your delayed bag(s) and will provide another update by tomorrow. You can also check the status here, with your reference number.""
6th March, 2023 – I decided to check myself to locate my luggage and found it on Delta’s website, I then tried to call Singapore – JFK and inform them of the situation and this is when they told me that they couldn’t help me and hung up the phone when I asked to speak to a supervisor.  Erroneously thinking that since I found the luggage that I would receive some help as I have been without clothes, toiletries and medicine for 2 days. 
I finally got through to Singapore JFK via e-mail and they now asked me for a photo  of my bag and of my flight details and boarding passes before they can help me. How bizarre? 

Questions for Singapore Airlines:
1.	Why was I told by JFK ground staff that my luggage on Delta airlines would be transferred to Singapore airlines, when it wasn’t. Even though I offered twice to retrieved my luggage myself the two staff members insisted that it wasn’t necessary as it will be handled. It wasn’t and of today 9th March, 2023 I still don’t have my luggage.
2.	Why is it at FRA airport where I was in transit that no staff was at the Singapore desk for most of the day. I did manage to find a person at the gate that told me they were too busy to assist me – I wanted to verify that my luggage was indeed transferred. 
3.	Why was I told when I arrived in Singapore by the staff at the service desk (next to F30) that my luggage was in the system and would be at my final destination – Phuket.
4.	Why could the ground staff at Phuket airport and Singapore airline online unable to find my luggage and kept sending e-mails that they have contacted every station for information.
5.	Why is it that when I called the Singapore customer service at JFK airport in NYC they told me that they can’t help me and hung up on my call.
6.	Most important – Why is it when I located the luggage myself 2 days later – as it was with Delta and informed all parties that my bag was in JFK Delta office that no personnel from either Singapore office made any attempt to retrieve my luggage. I had to call Delta in Atlanta and ask them to contact Singapore ground staff at JFK and inform them that the luggage they are looking for is at JFK.",0.03,0.938,0.033,0.5937,0.4633525013923645,0.48108890652656555,0.05555863305926323,1

"Unfortunately, I am leaving a one-star review for Singapore Airlines, despite my on-plane experience being great (flight crew were friendly and helpful, food was good, etc. no complaints there). 

However, I had transferred 220,000 AMEX points to Singapore Airlines in order to book a business class ticket (as you might know, this has a cash equivalent of at minimum several thousand dollars). The way many of their flights work, is you must waitlist the seat and then you will be allowed to book it if nobody pays cash for the seat. So, I also booked an economy seat for myself in case business ended up filling up (you don't get notified until close to your departure date). 

When I arrived to the airport on my travel day, I was informed that my business class ticket had gone through as there were 10 seats available in business class on my flight. However, after about an hour of deliberation, and right before I was set to board - I was informed that I would actually not be able to sit in business class. What gives? I rolled with it - but, now I have a couple hundred thousand points trapped in Singapore that I seemingly can't use. If there is available space on the flight and I have the points, why can't I use them? Isn't that the whole point? 

I've been in touch with Singapore Airlines customer service but they've not been helpful at all. I've only received barely comprehensible responses (I understand that English may not be everyone's first language but would expect that a global company could have a strong English speaker respond to emails where necessary) that don't try to find any middle ground with me or admit any fault on behalf of the airline.

A few months ago I booked my flight from Boston to Phuket. I had to stops one from jfk to 🇲🇾 and to Phuket. My first flight was delay and I arrived about one hour and 20 minutes before my flight.

Security was called on me and she marked me as a no show. 3 months later I was still fighting with EDreams due to this no show. I called Singapore and explained the situation and file complained. Due to this flight I had to canceled other flights and booking. They promised me a refund and told me to wait 3 months for the process and now 6 months later they refused me to refund again and I had to start from scratch.
