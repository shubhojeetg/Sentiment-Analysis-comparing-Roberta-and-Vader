 Review Sentiment Analysis Toolkit

Make sense of what people are really saying—no matter the product, service, or domain. This easy-to-use toolkit reads your review data, helps you spot patterns and trends, and lets you export the results for reporting or further research. It’s designed for everyone: analysts, researchers, business owners, or curious minds who want to dig deeper into customer feedback.

 What Makes This Toolkit Special?

- Fits Any Review Dataset: It doesn't matter if your data is about hotels, books, software, or sandwiches—if you have a review column and a rating column, you're set.
- Flexible Inputs: You decide which columns in your dataset represent the text of the review and its rating. No need to reformat or restructure your data!
- Two Brains Are Better: The script uses both the VADER method (a reliable, dictionary-based approach) and RoBERTa (a powerful context-aware language model). You get both perspectives, side by side.
- RoBERTa’s Edge: Thanks to its deeper understanding, RoBERTa is especially good at interpreting tricky phrases, humor, or modern language—often outperforming more basic tools in real-world data.
- Quick or Deep Dives: By default, it examines the first 500 reviews for speed. You can change this to analyze more or your entire dataset.
- Immediate Visuals: See helpful charts that reveal how sentiment and ratings interact and change across your data.
- Export-Friendly: Results can be easily saved as a CSV file for further work or sharing.

 Step-by-Step Guide

 1. Get Ready

- Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.
- Get the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, tqdm, transformers, scipy.

 2. Download and Launch

- Clone the repository to your local system:
  
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/general-review-sentiment-analysis.git
  
  cd general-review-sentiment-analysis
  
- Install the requirements:
  
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk tqdm transformers scipy
  
- Run the main script:
  
  python sentiment_analysis.py
  

 3. Simple User Prompts

As the script starts, it asks which column is your review text (`review`, `comment`, `summary`, etc.) and which one is your rating (`stars`, `score`, etc.). This makes it flexible for any dataset shape.

 4. What Happens Next?

- The toolkit checks your inputs, selects the relevant columns, and standardizes them.
- It plots the count of each rating, giving a quick sense of your data spread.
- Sentiment is analyzed two ways:
  - VADER: Assigns negative, neutral, positive, and compound scores to each review.
  - RoBERTa: Predicts probabilities for each sentiment class. RoBERTa’s advanced language skills help it understand slang, context, and subtle cues much better.
- All the sentiment data gets merged with the original data.

 5. Output and Visualization

- The enriched dataset is saved as `sentiment_results.csv`.
- Visuals pop up—including:
  - Bar charts showing how reviews are distributed across ratings.
  - Plots for average sentiment scores for each rating.
  - Pairplots to explore the relationships among all sentiment scores.

 Here's a Glimpse at the Results

| Review Summary                   | Rating | VADER Neg | VADER Neu | VADER Pos | VADER Compound | RoBERTa Pos | RoBERTa Neg |
|----------------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Fantastic service and quality.   | 5      | 0.02      | 0.55      | 0.43      | 0.89          | 0.93        | 0.02        |
| ...                              | ...    | ...       | ...       | ...       | ...           | ...         | ...         |

 Why Two Sentiment Methods?

- **RoBERTa's Superpower:** While VADER is fast and good for general language, RoBERTa can recognize sophisticated language and cultural references, giving you better accuracy—especially when reviews use expressions, jokes, or frustration that might confuse simpler models.
- **VADER’s Strength:** Works quickly out-of-the-box and can serve as a useful comparison point.
- Combining both gives you the best of precision and reliability.

 Customizing Further

- Use any review/rating data—just specify the column names.
- Change how many rows are analyzed by editing one line (`df.head(500)`).
- Want to try more sentiment models? The script is built so you can plug others in.
